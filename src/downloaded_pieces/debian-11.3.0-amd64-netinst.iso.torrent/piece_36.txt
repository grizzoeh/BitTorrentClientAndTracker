 the unstable distribution is that
you are always up-to-date with the latest in GNU/Linux software industry, but
if it breaks: you get to keep both parts :-)
</p><p>
There are also main, contrib and non-free subdirectories in `unstable',
separated on the same criteria as in `stable'.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="dirtree"></a>6.7.Â What are all those directories at the Debian FTP archives?</h2></div></div></div><p>
The software that has been packaged for Debian GNU/Linux is available in one of
several directory trees on each Debian mirror site.
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">dists</code> directory is short for "distributions", and it is
the canonical way to access the currently available Debian releases (and
pre-releases).
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">pool</code> directory contains the actual packages, see <a class="xref" href="ftparchives.en.html#pools" title="6.10.Â What's in the pool directory?">SectionÂ 6.10, â€œWhat's in the <code class="literal">pool</code> directory?â€</a>.
</p><p>
There are the following supplementary directories:
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>/tools/</em></span>:</span></dt><dd><p>
DOS utilities for creating boot disks, partitioning your disk drive,
compressing/decompressing files, and booting Linux.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>/doc/</em></span>:</span></dt><dd><p>
The basic Debian documentation, such as this FAQ, the bug reporting system
instructions, etc.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>/indices/</em></span>:</span></dt><dd><p>
various indices of the site (the Maintainers file and the override files).
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>/project/</em></span>:</span></dt><dd><p>
mostly developer-only materials and some miscellaneous files.
</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="archsections"></a>6.8.Â What are all those directories inside <code class="literal">dists/stable/main</code>?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Within each of the major directory trees<a href="#ftn.idm899" class="footnote" id="idm899"><sup class="footnote">[3]</sup></a>, there are
three sets of subdirectories containing index files.
</p><p>
There's one set of
<code class="literal">binary-<em class="replaceable"><code>something</code></em></code> subdirectories
which contain index files for binary packages of each available computer
architecture, for example <code class="literal">binary-i386</code> for packages which
execute on Intel x86 PC machines or <code class="literal">binary-sparc</code> for
packages which execute on Sun SPARCStations.
</p><p>
The complete list of available architectures for each release is available at
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/releases" target="_top">the release's web page</a>.
For the current release, please see <a class="xref" href="compatibility.en.html#arches" title="4.1.Â On what hardware architectures/systems does Debian GNU/Linux run?">SectionÂ 4.1, â€œOn what hardware architectures/systems does Debian GNU/Linux run?â€</a>.
</p><p>
The index files in binary-* are called Packages(.gz, .bz2) and they include a
summary of each binary package that is included in that distribution.  The
actual binary packages reside in the top level <a class="link" href="ftparchives.en.html#pools" title="6.10.Â What's in the pool directory?"><code class="literal">pool</code> directory</a>.
</p><p>
Furthermore, there's a subdirectory called source/ which contains index files
for source packages included in the distribution.  The index file is called
Sources(.gz, .bz2).
</p><p>
Last but not least, there's a set of subdirectories meant for the installation
system index files, they are at
<code class="literal">debian-installer/binary-<em class="replaceable"><code>architecture</code></em></code>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="source"></a>6.9.Â Where is the source code?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Source code is included for everything in the Debian system.  Moreover, the
license terms of most programs in the system <span class="emphasis"><em>require</em></span> that
source code be distributed along with the programs, or that an offer to provide
the source code accompany the programs.
</p><p>
The source code is distributed in the <code class="literal">pool</code> directory (see
<a class="xref" href="ftparchives.en.html#pools" title="6.10.Â What's in the pool directory?">SectionÂ 6.10, â€œWhat's in the <code class="literal">pool</code> directory?â€</a>) together with all the architecture-specific binary
directories.  To retrieve the source code without having to be familiar with
the structure of the FTP archive, try a command like <code class="literal">apt-get source
mypackagename</code>.
</p><p>
Due to restrictions in their licenses, source code may or may not be available
for packages in the "contrib" and "non-free" areas, which are not formally part
of the Debian system.  In some cases only sourceless "binary blobs" can be
distributed (see for instance <code class="literal">firmware-misc-nonfree</code>); in
other cases the license prohibits the distribution of prebuilt binaries, but
does allow packages of source code which users can compile locally (see
<code class="literal">broadcom-sta-dkms</code>).
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pools"></a>6.10.Â What's in the <code class="literal">pool</code> directory?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Packages are kept in a large `pool', structured according to the name of the
source package.  To make this manageable, the pool is subdivided by section
(`main', `contrib' and `non-free') and by the first letter of the source
package name.  These directories contain several files: the binary packages for
each architecture, and the source packages from which the binary packages were
generated.
</p><p>
You can find out where each package is placed by executing a command like
<code class="literal">apt-cache showsrc mypackagename</code> and looking at the
`Directory:' line.  For example, the <code class="literal">apache</code> packages are
stored in <code class="literal">pool/main/a/apache/</code>.
</p><p>
Additionally, since there are so many <code class="literal">lib*</code> packages, these
are treated specially: for instance, libpaper packages are stored in
<code class="literal">pool/main/libp/libpaper/</code>.
</p><p>
<a href="#ftn.idm943" class="footnote" id="idm943"><sup class="footnote">[4]</sup></a>
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="incoming"></a>6.11.Â What is "incoming"?</h2></div></div></div><p>
After a developer uploads a package, it stays for a short while in the
"incoming" directory before it is checked that it's genuine and allowed into
the archive.
</p><p>
Usually nobody should install things from this place.  However, in some rare
cases of emergency, the incoming directory is available at <a class="ulink" href="https://incoming.debian.org/" target="_top">https://incoming.debian.org/</a>.  You can
manually fetch packages, check the GPG signature and MD5sums in the .changes
and .dsc files, and then install them.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ownrepository"></a>6.12.Â How do I set up my own apt-able repository?</h2></div></div></div><p>
If you have built some private Debian packages which you'd like to install
using the standard Debian package management tools, you can set up your own
apt-able package archive.  This is also useful if you'd like to share your
Debian packages while these are not distributed by the Debian project.
Instructions on how to do this are given on the <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.debian.org/HowToSetupADebianRepository" target="_top">Debian Wiki</a>.
</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br /><hr width="100" align="left" /><div id="ftn.idm821" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm821" class="para"><sup class="para">[2] </sup></a> When the present-day sid did not exist, the FTP site
organization had one major flaw: there was an assumption that when an
architecture is created in the current unstable, it will be released when that
distribution becomes the new stable.  For many architectures that isn't the
case, with the result that those directories had to be moved at release time.
This was impractical because the move would chew up lots of bandwidth.  </p><p> The archive administrators worked around this problem for several years
by placing binaries for unreleased architectures in a special directory called
"sid".  For those architectures not yet released, the first time they were
released there was a link from the current stable to sid, and from then on they
were created inside the unstable tree as normal.  This layout was somewhat
confusing to users.  </p><p> With the advent of package pools (see <a class="xref" href="ftparchives.en.html#pools" title="6.10.Â What's in the pool directory?">SectionÂ 6.10, â€œWhat's in the <code class="literal">pool</code> directory?â€</a>), binary packages began to be stored in a canonical location
in the pool, regardless of the distribution, so releasing a distribution no
longer causes large bandwidth consumption on the mirrors (there is, however, a
lot of gradual bandwidth consumption throughout the development process).

The official document giving installation instructions is the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual" target="_top">Debian GNU/Linux
Installation Guide</a>.  We'll give some additional notes about getting and
installing Debian GNU/Linux here.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="version"></a>2.1.Â What is the latest version of Debian?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Currently there are three versions of Debian GNU/Linux:
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>release 10, a.k.a. the `stable' distribution or buster</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
This is stable and well tested software, it changes if major security or
usability fixes are incorporated.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>the `testing' distribution, currently called bullseye</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
This is where packages that will be released as the next `stable' are placed;
they've had some testing in unstable but they may not be completely fit for
release yet.  This distribution is updated more often than `stable', but not
more often than `unstable'.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>the `unstable' distribution</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>
This is the version currently under development; it is updated continuously.
You can retrieve packages from the `unstable' archive on any Debian FTP site
and use them to upgrade your system at any time, but you may not expect the
system to be as usable or as stable as before - that's why it's called
`<span class="strong"><strong>unstable</strong></span>'!
</p></dd></dl></div><p>
Please see <a class="xref" href="ftparchives.en.html#dists" title="6.1.Â How many Debian distributions are there?">SectionÂ 6.1, â€œHow many Debian distributions are there?â€</a> for more information.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="updatestable"></a>2.2.Â Are there package upgrades in `stable'?</h2></div></div></div><p>
No new functionality is added to the stable release.  Once a Debian version is
released and tagged `stable' it will only get security updates.  That is, only
packages for which a security vulnerability has been found after the release
will be upgraded.  All the security updates are served through <a class="ulink" href="ftp://security.debian.org" target="_top">security.debian.org</a>.
</p><p>
Security updates serve one purpose: to supply a fix for a security
vulnerability.  They are not a method for sneaking additional changes into the
stable release without going through normal point release procedure.
Consequently, fixes for packages with security issues will not upgrade the
software.  The Debian Security Team will backport the necessary fixes to the
version of the software distributed in `stable' instead.
</p><p>
For more information related to security support please read the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/security/faq" target="_top">Security FAQ</a> or the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/" target="_top">Debian Security
Manual</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="inst-disks"></a>2.3.Â Where/how can I get the Debian installation images?</h2></div></div></div><p>
You can get the installation images by downloading the appropriate files from
the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/" target="_top">Debian website</a>.
</p><p>
Please refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/CD" target="_top">Debian GNU/Linux on
CDs</a> for more information about CD (and DVD) images.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="cdrom"></a>2.4.Â How do I install Debian from CD-ROMs?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Installing Debian from CD is straightforward: configure your system for booting
off a CD, insert your CD, and reboot.  Your system will now be running the
Debian Installer.  See the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/installmanual" target="_top">Debian GNU/Linux
Installation Guide</a> for more information.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="cdimage-symlinks"></a>2.5.Â Why does the official stable released CD-ROM contain symlinks for `frozen' and `unstable'? I thought this CD contains just `stable'!</h2></div></div></div><p>
Official Debian CD images indeed contain symlinks like:
</p><pre class="screen">
 /dists/frozen -&gt; buster/
 /dists/stable -&gt; buster/
 /dists/testing -&gt; buster/
 /dists/unstable -&gt; buster/
</pre><p>
so that they work when your sources.list has an entry like
</p><pre class="screen">
 deb cdrom:[&lt;name as on cd label&gt;]/ unstable main [...]
</pre><p>
.
</p><p>
The fact these symlinks are present does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mean the
image is `unstable' or `testing' or anything.  Read the CD label in
<code class="filename">/.disk/info</code> to find out which Debian version it contains.
This information is also present in <code class="filename">/README.txt</code> on the CD.
</p><p>
Read <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/releases" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/releases</a>
to find out what the current `stable' and `testing' releases are.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="remoteinstall"></a>2.6.Â Can I get and install Debian directly from a remote Internet site?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Yes.  You can boot the Debian installation system from a set of files you can
download from our FTP site and its mirrors.
</p><p>
You can download a small CD image file, create a bootable CD from it, install
the basic system from it and the rest over the network.  For more information
please see <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="alternativebootinstaller"></a>2.7.Â Are there any alternative strategies for booting the system installer?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Yes.  Apart from CD or DVD, you can install Debian GNU/Linux by booting from
USB memory stick, directly from hard disk, or using TFTP net booting.  For
installing on multiple computers it's possible to do fully automatic
installations.  NB: not all methods are supported by all computer
architectures.  Once the installer has booted, the rest of the system can be

Yes.
</p><p>
There's only one common catch: the Debian C libraries are built with the most
recent <span class="emphasis"><em>stable</em></span> releases of the <span class="strong"><strong>kernel</strong></span> headers.  If you happen to need to compile a
program with kernel headers newer than the ones from the stable branch, then
you should either upgrade the package containing the headers (<code class="systemitem">linux-libc-dev</code><a id="idm1793" class="indexterm"></a>), or use the new headers from an
unpacked tree of the newer kernel.  That is, if the kernel sources are in
<code class="filename">/usr/src/linux</code>, then you should add
<code class="literal">-I/usr/src/linux/include/</code> to your command line when
compiling.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="customkernel"></a>10.2.Â What tools does Debian provide to build custom kernels?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Users who wish to (or must) build a custom kernel are encouraged to use the
Debian package target included with recent versions of the kernel build system.
After configuring the kernel, simply run the following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
make deb-pkg
</pre><p>
The new kernel package will be created in the directory one level above the
kernel source tree, and it may be installed using <code class="literal">dpkg -i</code>.
</p><p>
Users must separately download the source code for the most recent kernel (or
the kernel of their choice) from their favorite Linux archive site, unless a
<code class="systemitem">linux-source-<em class="replaceable"><code>version</code></em></code><a id="idm1807" class="indexterm"></a>
package is available (where <em class="replaceable"><code>version</code></em> stands for the
kernel version).
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="modules"></a>10.3.Â What special provisions does Debian provide to deal with modules?</h2></div></div></div><p>
A configuration file containing modules to be manually loaded at boot time is
kept at <code class="filename">/etc/modules</code>.  However, editing this file is
rarely needed.
</p><p>
Other module configuration is kept in the <code class="filename">/etc/modprobe.d/</code>
directory.  More information about the format of those files can be found in
the
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">modprobe.conf</span>(5)</span>
manual page.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="removeoldkernel"></a>10.4.Â Can I safely de-install an old kernel package, and if so, how?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Yes.  The <span class="command"><strong>linux-image-<em class="replaceable"><code>NNN</code></em>.prerm</strong></span>
script checks to see whether the kernel you are currently running is the same
as the kernel you are trying to de-install.  Therefore you can remove unwanted
kernel image packages using this command:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --purge linux-image-<em class="replaceable"><code>NNN</code></em>
</pre><p>
(replace <em class="replaceable"><code>NNN</code></em> with your kernel version and revision
number, of course)

With each new release, the Debian project tries to focus on a set of topics.
These are known as "Release Goals" and they are all described in <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/" target="_top">https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/</a>.
Please note that the following sections might not be fully up-to-date, please
refer to the Wiki for more information and the up-to-date status of these
goals.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="hardening"></a>15.1.Â Hardening the system</h2></div></div></div><p>
It is a goal for the Debian project to ensure that any system installed is
hardened and secure against attacks.  There are several ways to achieve this,
which include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
Improve programs' security by compiling them with <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.debian.org/ReleaseGoals/SecurityHardeningBuildFlags" target="_top">Security
Hardening Build Flags</a> in order to enable various protections against
known security issues,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Improve the default system configuration to make it less vulnerable to attacks
(both local or remote),
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Enable security features delivered by new versions of the kernel.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All of these are done in an ongoing basis.  For the first item, a set of
security hardening build flags that try to prevent known attacks such as stack
smashing, predictable locations of values in memory, etc.  is used.  The target
is to cover at least all packages that are part of the basic installation as
well as packages that had to be updated through a Security Advisory since 2006.
As of this writing, around 400 packages have been modified since this effort
was first started.  All the issues are <a class="ulink" href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=goal-hardening;users=hardening-discuss@lists.alioth.debian.org" target="_top">tracked
in the BTS</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="i18n"></a>15.2.Â Extended support for non-English users</h2></div></div></div><p>
Debian already has very good support for non-English users, see <a class="xref" href="software.en.html#nonenglish" title="5.9.Â How does Debian support non-English languages?">SectionÂ 5.9, â€œHow does Debian support non-English languages?â€</a>.
</p><p>
We hope to find people who will provide support for even more languages, and
translate programs and documents.  Many programs and Debian-specific documents
already support internationalization, so we need message catalogs translators.
However, still some programs remain to be properly internationalized.
</p><p>
The GNU Translation Project <a class="ulink" href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS" target="_top">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS</a>
works on internationalizing the GNU programs and different projects, such as
the Desktop environments GNOME or KDE have their own translation teams.  The
goal of Debian is not to replace or to repeat the work done by these projects,
indeed, Debian benefits from the work done by translators in these projects.
However, there are still many programs which are not in the scope of those
projects and which are translated within Debian.
</p><p>
Previous Debian releases have focused in topics such as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
I18n support in all debconf-using packages: Packages using the Debian
configuration management must allow for translation of all messages displayed
to the user during package configuration.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
I18n support for package descriptions: Update package management frontends to
use the translated descriptions of packages.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
UTF-8 debian/changelog and debian/control.  This way, e.g. names of people
from asian countries can get typeset the right way in changelogs.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
I18n support in the Debian Installer including full support for some languages
that require the use of the graphical interface.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="di"></a>15.3.Â Improvements in the Debian Installer</h2></div></div></div><p>
Lots of work has been done on the Debian Installer, resulting in major
improvements.  We'll mention just two of them here.
</p><p>
Starting the installer from Microsoft Windows: It is now possible to start the
installer directly from Microsoft Windows without the need to change BIOS
settings.  Upon insertion of a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or USB stick, an autorun program
will be started, offering a step-by-step process to start the Debian Installer.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="morearches"></a>15.4.Â More architectures</h2></div></div></div><p>
Complete Debian system on other architectures.  Notice that even though some
architectures are dropped for a given release, there still might be a way to
install and upgrade using the latest <code class="literal">sid</code>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="morekernels"></a>15.5.Â More kernels</h2></div></div></div><p>
In addition to Debian GNU/Hurd, Debian is being ported also to BSD kernels,

There are multiple tools that are used to manage Debian packages, from graphic
or text-based interfaces to the low level tools used to install packages.  All
the available tools rely on the lower level tools to properly work and are
presented here in decreasing complexity level.
</p><p>
It is important to understand that the higher level package management tools
such as <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>synaptic</strong></span> rely on
<span class="command"><strong>apt</strong></span> which, itself, relies on <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> to
manage the packages in the system.
</p><p>
See <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch02.en.html" target="_top">Chapter
2.  Debian package management</a> of the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/" target="_top">Debian
reference</a> for more information about the Debian package management
utilities.  This document is available in various languages and formats, see
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals#quick-reference" target="_top">the Debian
Reference entry in the DDP Users' Manuals overview</a>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="dpkg"></a>8.1.1.Â dpkg</h3></div></div></div><p>
This is the main package management program.  <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> can be
invoked with many options.  Some common uses are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
Find out all the options: <code class="literal">dpkg --help</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Print out the control file (and other information) for a specified package:
<code class="literal">dpkg --info foo_VVV-RRR.deb</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Install a package (including unpacking and configuring) onto the file system of
the hard disk: <code class="literal">dpkg --install foo_VVV-RRR.deb</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Unpack (but do not configure) a Debian archive into the file system of the hard
disk: <code class="literal">dpkg --unpack foo_VVV-RRR.deb</code>.  Note that this
operation does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> necessarily leave the package in a
usable state; some files may need further customization to run properly.  This
command removes any already-installed version of the program and runs the
preinst (see <a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#maintscripts" title="7.6.Â What is a Debian preinst, postinst, prerm, and postrm script?">SectionÂ 7.6, â€œWhat is a Debian preinst, postinst, prerm, and postrm script?â€</a>) script associated with the
package.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Configure a package that already has been unpacked: <code class="literal">dpkg --configure
foo</code>.  Among other things, this action runs the postinst (see <a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#maintscripts" title="7.6.Â What is a Debian preinst, postinst, prerm, and postrm script?">SectionÂ 7.6, â€œWhat is a Debian preinst, postinst, prerm, and postrm script?â€</a>) script associated with the package.  It also updates
the files listed in the <code class="literal">conffiles</code> for this package.  Notice
that the 'configure' operation takes as its argument a package name (e.g.,
foo), <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the name of a Debian archive file (e.g.,
foo_VVV-RRR.deb).
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Extract a single file named "blurf" (or a group of files named "blurf*") from a
Debian archive: <code class="literal">dpkg --fsys-tarfile foo_VVV-RRR.deb | tar -xf -
'blurf*'</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Remove a package (but not its configuration files): <code class="literal">dpkg --remove
foo</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Remove a package (including its configuration files): <code class="literal">dpkg --purge
foo</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
List the installation status of packages containing the string (or regular
expression) "foo*": <code class="literal">dpkg --list 'foo*'</code>.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="apt-get"></a>8.1.2.Â APT</h3></div></div></div><p>
APT is the <span class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Package Tool</em></span>, an advanced interface to
the Debian packaging system which provides the <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>
program.  It provides commandline tools for searching and managing packages,
and for querying information about them, as well as low-level access to all
features of the libapt-pkg library.  For more information, see the User's Guide
in <code class="literal">/usr/share/doc/apt-doc/guide.html/index.html</code> (you will
have to install the <code class="systemitem">apt-doc</code><a id="idm1380" class="indexterm"></a> package).
</p><p>
Starting with Debian Jessie, some frequently used <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>
and <span class="command"><strong>apt-cache</strong></span> commands have an equivalent via the new
<span class="command"><strong>apt</strong></span> binary.  This means some popular commands like
<span class="command"><strong>apt-get update</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>apt-get install</strong></span>,
<span class="command"><strong>apt-get remove</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>apt-cache search</strong></span>, or
<span class="command"><strong>apt-cache show</strong></span> now can also be called simply via
<span class="command"><strong>apt</strong></span>, say <span class="command"><strong>apt update</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>apt
install</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>apt remove</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>apt
search</strong></span>, or <span class="command"><strong>apt show</strong></span>.  The following is an overview
of the old and new commands:
</p><pre class="screen">
 apt-get update             -&gt;  apt update
 apt-get upgrade            -&gt;  apt upgrade
 apt-get dist-upgrade       -&gt;  apt full-upgrade
 apt-get install package    -&gt;  apt install package
 apt-get remove package     -&gt;  apt remove package
 apt-get autoremove         -&gt;  apt autoremove
 apt-cache search string    -&gt;  apt search string
 apt-cache policy package   -&gt;  apt list -a package
 apt-cache show package     -&gt;  apt show package
 apt-cache showpkg package  -&gt;  apt show -a package
</pre><p>
The <span class="command"><strong>apt</strong></span> tool merges functionality of apt-get and apt-cache
and by default has a fancier colored output format, making it more pleasant for
humans.  For usage in scripts or advanced use cases, apt-get is still
preferable or needed.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span> provides a simple way to retrieve and install
packages from multiple sources using the command line.  Unlike
<span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span> does not understand .deb
files, it works with the packages proper name and can only install .deb
archives from a source specified in <code class="filename">/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.
<span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span> will call <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> directly after
downloading the .deb archives<a href="#ftn.idm1408" class="footnote" id="idm1408"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a> from
the configured sources.
</p><p>
Some common ways to use <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span> are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
To update the list of packages known by your system, you can run:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt update
</pre><p>
(you should execute this regularly to update your package lists)
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To install the <em class="replaceable"><code>foo</code></em> package and all its dependencies,
run:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt install foo
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To remove the foo package from your system, run:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt remove foo
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To remove the foo package and its configuration files from your system, run:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt purge foo
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To list all packages for which newer versions are available, run:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt list --upgradable
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To upgrade all the packages on your system (without installing extra packages
or removing packages), run:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt upgrade
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To upgrade all the packages on your system, and, if needed for a package
upgrade, installing extra packages or removing packages, run:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt full-upgrade
</pre><p>
(The command <code class="literal">upgrade</code> keeps a package at its installed
obsolete version if upgrading would need an extra package to be installed, for
a new dependency to be satisfied.  The <code class="literal">full-upgrade</code> command
is less conservative.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that you must be logged in as root to perform any commands that modify
packages.
</p><p>
Note that <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span> now also installs recommended packages as
default, and thanks to its robustness it's the preferred program for package
management from console to perform system installation and major system
upgrades.
</p><p>
The apt tool suite also includes the <span class="command"><strong>apt-cache</strong></span> tool to query
the package lists.  You can use it to find packages providing specific
functionality through simple text or regular expression queries and through
queries of dependencies in the package management system.  Some common ways to
use <span class="command"><strong>apt-cache</strong></span> are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
To find packages whose description contain <em class="replaceable"><code>word</code></em>:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt search <em class="replaceable"><code>word</code></em>
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To print the detailed information of a package:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt show <em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To print the packages a given package depends on:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-cache depends <em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
To print detailed information on the versions available for a package and the
packages that reverse-depends on it:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-cache showpkg <em class="replaceable"><code>package</code></em>
</pre></li></ul></div><p>

</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="aptitude"></a>8.1.3.Â aptitude</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> is a package manager for Debian GNU/Linux systems
that provides a frontend to the apt package management infrastructure.
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> is a text-based interface using the curses library.
Actions may be performed from a visual interface or from the command-line.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> can be used to perform management tasks in a fast
and easy way.  It allows the user to view the list of packages and to perform
package management tasks such as installing, upgrading, and removing packages.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> provides the functionality of
<span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>, as well as many additional features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> offers easy access to all versions of a package.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> makes it easy to keep track of obsolete software by
listing it under "Obsolete and Locally Created Packages".
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> includes a fairly powerful system for searching
particular packages and limiting the package display.  Users familiar with
<span class="command"><strong>mutt</strong></span> will pick up quickly, as <span class="command"><strong>mutt</strong></span> was
the inspiration for the expression syntax.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> can be used to install the predefined tasks
available.  For more information see <a class="xref" href="pkgtools.en.html#tasksel" title="8.1.5.Â tasksel">SectionÂ 8.1.5, â€œtaskselâ€</a>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> in full screen mode has <span class="command"><strong>su</strong></span>
functionality embedded and can be run by a normal user.  It will call
<span class="command"><strong>su</strong></span> (and ask for the root password, if any) when you really
need administrative privileges.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can use <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> through a visual interface (simply run
<code class="literal">aptitude</code>) or directly from the command line.  The command
line syntax used is very similar to the one used in <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>.
For example, to install the <em class="replaceable"><code>foo</code></em> package, you can run
<code class="literal">aptitude install <em class="replaceable"><code>foo</code></em></code>.
</p><p>
Note that <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> is the preferred program for daily
package management from the console.
</p><p>
For more information, read the manual page
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">aptitude</span>(8)</span>
and install the <code class="systemitem">aptitude-doc</code><a id="idm1528" class="indexterm"></a> package.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="synaptic"></a>8.1.4.Â synaptic</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="command"><strong>synaptic</strong></span> is a graphical package manager.  It enables you to
install, upgrade and remove software packages in a user friendly way.  Along
with most of the features offered by aptitude, it also has a feature for
editing the list of used repositories, and supports browsing all available
documentation related to a package.  See the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.nongnu.org/synaptic/" target="_top">Synaptic Website</a> for more
information.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tasksel"></a>8.1.5.Â tasksel</h3></div></div></div><p>
When you want to perform a specific task it might be difficult to find the
appropiate suite of packages that fill your need.  The Debian developers have
defined <code class="literal">tasks</code>, a task is a collection of several individual
Debian packages all related to a specific activity.  Tasks can be installed
through the <span class="command"><strong>tasksel</strong></span> program or through
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span>.
</p><p>
Typically, the Debian installer will automatically install the task associated
with a standard system and a desktop environment.  The specific desktop
environment installed will depend on the CD/DVD media used, most commonly it
will be the GNOME desktop (<code class="literal">gnome-desktop</code> task).  Also,
depending on your selections throughout the installation process, tasks might
be automatically installed in your system.  For example, if you selected a
language other than English, the task associated with it will be installed
automatically too and if the installer recognises you are installing on a
laptop system the <code class="literal">laptop</code> task will also be installed.

This program manipulates Debian archive (<code class="literal">.deb</code>) files.  Some
common uses are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
Find out all the options: <code class="literal">dpkg-deb --help</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Extract the files contained in a named Debian archive into a user specified
directory: <code class="literal">dpkg-deb --extract foo_VVV-RRR.deb tmp</code> extracts
each of the files in <code class="literal">foo_VVV-RRR.deb</code> into the directory
<code class="literal">tmp/</code>.  This is convenient for examining the contents of a
package in a localized directory, without installing the package into the root
file system.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Extract the control information files from a package: <code class="literal">dpkg-deb
--control foo_VVV-RRR.deb tmp</code>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that any packages that were merely unpacked using <code class="literal">dpkg-deb
--extract</code> will be incorrectly installed, you should use <code class="literal">dpkg
--install</code> instead.

The kernel (file system) in Debian GNU/Linux systems supports replacing files
even while they're being used.
</p><p>
We also provide a program called <span class="command"><strong>start-stop-daemon</strong></span> which is
used to start daemons at boot time or to stop daemons when the runlevel is
changed (e.g., from multi-user to single-user or to halt).  The same program is
used by installation scripts when a new package containing a daemon is
installed, to stop running daemons, and restart them as necessary.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="whatpackages"></a>8.3.Â How can I tell what packages are already installed on a Debian system?</h2></div></div></div><p>
To learn the status of all the packages installed on a Debian system, execute
the command
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --list
</pre><p>
This prints out a one-line summary for each package, giving a 2-letter status
symbol (explained in the header), the package name, the version which is
<span class="emphasis"><em>installed</em></span>, and a brief description.
</p><p>
To learn the status of packages whose names match any pattern beginning with
"foo", run the command:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --list 'foo*'
</pre><p>
To get a more verbose report for a particular package, execute the command:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --status packagename
</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="listfiles"></a>8.4.Â How do I display the files of an installed package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
To list all the files provided by the installed package <code class="literal">foo</code>
execute the command
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --listfiles foo
</pre><p>
Note that the files created by the installation scripts aren't displayed.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="filesearch"></a>8.5.Â How can I find out what package produced a particular file?</h2></div></div></div><p>
To identify the package that produced the file named <code class="literal">foo</code>
execute either:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
<code class="literal">dpkg --search foo</code>
</p><p>
This searches for <code class="literal">foo</code> in installed packages.  (This is
(currently) equivalent to searching all of the files having the file extension
of <code class="literal">.list</code> in the directory
<code class="literal">/var/lib/dpkg/info/</code>, and adjusting the output to print the
names of all the packages containing it, and diversions.)
</p><p>
A faster alternative to this is the <span class="command"><strong>dlocate</strong></span> tool.
</p><pre class="screen">
dlocate -S foo
</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<code class="literal">zgrep foo Contents-ARCH.gz</code>
</p><p>
This searches for files which contain the substring <code class="literal">foo</code> in
their full path names.  The files <code class="literal">Contents-ARCH.gz</code> (where
ARCH represents the wanted architecture) reside in the major package
directories (main, non-free, contrib) at a Debian FTP site (i.e. under
<code class="literal">/debian/dists/buster</code>).  A <code class="literal">Contents</code> file
refers only to the packages in the subdirectory tree where it resides.
Therefore, a user might have to search more than one
<code class="literal">Contents</code> files to find the package containing the file
<code class="literal">foo</code>.
</p><p>
This method has the advantage over <code class="literal">dpkg --search</code> in that it
will find files in packages that are not currently installed on your system.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<code class="literal">apt-file search <em class="replaceable"><code>foo</code></em></code>
</p><p>
If you install the <code class="systemitem">apt-file</code><a id="idm1627" class="indexterm"></a> package,
similar to the above, it searches files which contain the substring or regular
expression <code class="literal">foo</code> in their full path names.  The advantage over
the example above is that there is no need to retrieve the
<code class="literal">Contents-ARCH.gz</code> files as it will do this automatically for
all the sources defined in <code class="filename">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> when you
run (as root) <code class="literal">apt-file update</code>.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="datapackages"></a>8.6.Â Why is `foo-data' not removed when I uninstall `foo'? How do I make sure old unused library-packages get purged?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Some packages are split in program (`foo') and data (`foo-data') (or in `foo'
and `foo-doc').  This is true for many games, multimedia applications and
dictionaries in Debian and has been introduced since some users might want to
access the raw data without installing the program or because the program can
be run without the data itself, making `foo-data' optional.
</p><p>
Similar situations occur when dealing with libraries: generally these get
installed since packages containing applications depend on them.  When the
application-package is purged, the library-package might stay on the system.
Or: when the application-package no longer depends upon e.g. libdb4.2, but
upon libdb4.3, the libdb4.2 package might stay when the application-package is
upgraded.
</p><p>
In these cases, `foo-data' doesn't depend on `foo', so when you remove the
`foo' package it will not get automatically removed by most package management
tools.  The same holds true for the library packages.  This is necessary to
avoid circular dependencies.  However, if you use <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>
(see <a class="xref" href="pkgtools.en.html#apt-get" title="8.1.2.Â APT">SectionÂ 8.1.2, â€œAPTâ€</a>) or <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="pkgtools.en.html#aptitude" title="8.1.3.Â aptitude">SectionÂ 8.1.3, â€œaptitudeâ€</a>) as your package management tool, they will track
automatically installed packages and give the possibility to remove them, when
no packages making use of them remain in your system.

This chapter touches on some lower level internals of Debian package
management.  If you're interested mainly in <span class="emphasis"><em>usage</em></span> of the
relevant tools, skip to chapters <a class="xref" href="pkgtools.en.html" title="ChapterÂ 8.Â The Debian package management tools">ChapterÂ 8, <em>The Debian package management tools</em></a> and/or <a class="xref" href="uptodate.en.html" title="ChapterÂ 9.Â Keeping your Debian system up-to-date">ChapterÂ 9, <em>Keeping your Debian system up-to-date</em></a>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="package"></a>7.1.Â What is a Debian package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Packages generally contain all of the files necessary to implement a set of
related commands or features.  There are two types of Debian packages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Binary packages</em></span>, which contain executables, configuration
files, man/info pages, copyright information, and other documentation.  These
packages are distributed in a Debian-specific archive format (see <a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#deb-format" title="7.2.Â What is the format of a Debian binary package?">SectionÂ 7.2, â€œWhat is the format of a Debian binary package?â€</a>); they are usually characterized by having a '.deb' file
extension.  Binary packages can be unpacked using the Debian utility
<code class="literal">dpkg</code> (possibly via a frontend like
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span>); details are given in its manual page.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Source packages</em></span>, which consist of a
<code class="literal">.dsc</code> file describing the source package (including the names
of the following files), a <code class="literal">.orig.tar.gz</code> file that contains
the original unmodified source in gzip-compressed tar format and usually a
<code class="literal">.diff.gz</code> file that contains the Debian-specific changes to
the original source.  The utility <code class="literal">dpkg-source</code> packs and
unpacks Debian source archives; details are provided in its manual page.  (The
program <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span> can be used as a frontend for
<code class="literal">dpkg-source</code>.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Installation of software by the package system uses "dependencies" which are
carefully designed by the package maintainers.  These dependencies are
documented in the <code class="literal">control</code> file associated with each package.
For example, the package containing the GNU C compiler (<code class="systemitem">gcc</code><a id="idm986" class="indexterm"></a>) "depends" on the package <code class="systemitem">binutils</code><a id="idm990" class="indexterm"></a> which includes the linker and assembler.
If a user attempts to install <code class="systemitem">gcc</code><a id="idm994" class="indexterm"></a>
without having first installed <code class="systemitem">binutils</code><a id="idm998" class="indexterm"></a>, the package management system (dpkg) will
send an error message that it also needs <code class="systemitem">binutils</code><a id="idm1002" class="indexterm"></a>, and stop installing <code class="systemitem">gcc</code><a id="idm1006" class="indexterm"></a>.  (However, this facility can be overridden by
the insistent user, see
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dpkg</span>(8)</span>.)
See more in <a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#depends" title="7.9.Â What is meant by saying that a package Depends, Recommends, Suggests, Conflicts, Replaces, Breaks or Provides another package?">SectionÂ 7.9, â€œWhat is meant by saying that a package <span class="emphasis"><em>Depends</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recommends</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Suggests</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Conflicts</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Replaces</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Breaks</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Provides</em></span> another package?â€</a> below.
</p><p>
Debian's packaging tools can be used to:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
manipulate and manage packages or parts of packages,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
administer local overrides of files in a package,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
aid developers in the construction of package archives, and
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
aid users in the installation of packages which reside on a remote FTP site.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="deb-format"></a>7.2.Â What is the format of a Debian binary package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
A Debian "package", or a Debian archive file, contains the executable files,
libraries, and documentation associated with a particular suite of program or
set of related programs.  Normally, a Debian archive file has a filename that
ends in <code class="literal">.deb</code>.
</p><p>
The internals of this Debian binary packages format are described in the
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">deb</span>(5)</span>
manual page.  This internal format is subject to change (between major releases
of Debian GNU/Linux), therefore please always use
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dpkg-deb</span>(1)</span>
if you need to do lowlevel manipulations on <code class="literal">.deb</code> files.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pkgname"></a>7.3.Â Why are Debian package file names so long?</h2></div></div></div><p>
The Debian binary package file names conform to the following convention:
&lt;foo&gt;_&lt;VersionNumber&gt;-&lt;DebianRevisionNumber&gt;_&lt;DebianArchitecture&gt;.deb
</p><p>
Note that <code class="literal">foo</code> is supposed to be the package name.  Checking
the package name associated with a particular Debian archive file (.deb file)
can be done in one of these ways:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
inspect the "Packages" file in the directory where it was stored at a Debian
FTP archive site.  This file contains a stanza describing each package; the
first field in each stanza is the formal package name.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
use the command <code class="literal">dpkg --info foo_VVV-RRR_AAA.deb</code> (where VVV,
RRR and AAA are the version, revision and architecture of the package in
question, respectively).  This displays, among other things, the package name
corresponding to the archive file being unpacked.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The <code class="literal">VVV</code> component is the version number specified by the
upstream developer.  There are no standards in place here, so the version
number may have formats as different as "19990513" and "1.3.8pre1".
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">RRR</code> component is the Debian revision number, and is
specified by the Debian developer (or an individual user if he chooses to build
the package himself).  This number corresponds to the revision level of the
Debian package, thus, a new revision level usually signifies changes in the
Debian Makefile (<code class="literal">debian/rules</code>), the Debian control file
(<code class="literal">debian/control</code>), the installation or removal scripts
(<code class="literal">debian/p*</code>), or in the configuration files used with the
package.
</p><p>
The <code class="literal">AAA</code> component identifies the processor for which the
package was built.  This is commonly <code class="literal">amd64</code>, which refers to
AMD64, Intel 64 or VIA Nano chips.  For other possibilities review Debian's FTP
directory structure at <a class="xref" href="ftparchives.en.html#dirtree" title="6.7.Â What are all those directories at the Debian FTP archives?">SectionÂ 6.7, â€œWhat are all those directories at the Debian FTP archives?â€</a>.  For details, see the
description of "Debian architecture" in the manual page

</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="controlfile"></a>7.4.Â What is a Debian control file?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Specifics regarding the contents of a Debian control file are provided in the
Debian Policy Manual, section 5, see <a class="xref" href="support.en.html#debiandocs" title="12.1.Â What other documentation exists on and for a Debian system?">SectionÂ 12.1, â€œWhat other documentation exists on and for a Debian system?â€</a>.

Briefly, a sample control file is shown below for the Debian package hello:
</p><pre class="screen">
Package: hello
Version: 2.9-2+deb8u1
Architecture: amd64
Maintainer: Santiago Vila &lt;sanvila@debian.org&gt;
Installed-Size: 145
Depends: libc6 (&gt;= 2.14)
Conflicts: hello-traditional
Breaks: hello-debhelper (&lt;&lt; 2.9)
Replaces: hello-debhelper (&lt;&lt; 2.9), hello-traditional
Section: devel
Priority: optional
Homepage: https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/
Description: example package based on GNU hello
 The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It
 allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which
 would otherwise be unavailable to them.
 .
 Seriously, though: this is an example of how to do a Debian package.
 It is the Debian version of the GNU Project's `hello world' program
 (which is itself an example for the GNU Project).
</pre><p>
The Package field gives the package name.  This is the name by which the
package can be manipulated by the package tools, and usually similar to but not
necessarily the same as the first component string in the Debian archive file
name.
</p><p>
The Version field gives both the upstream developer's version number and (in
the last component) the revision level of the Debian package of this program as
explained in <a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#pkgname" title="7.3.Â Why are Debian package file names so long?">SectionÂ 7.3, â€œWhy are Debian package file names so long?â€</a>.
</p><p>
The Architecture field specifies the chip for which this particular binary was
compiled.
</p><p>
The Depends field gives a list of packages that have to be installed in order
to install this package successfully.
</p><p>
The Installed-Size indicates how much disk space the installed package will
consume.  This is intended to be used by installation front-ends in order to
show whether there is enough disk space available to install the program.
</p><p>
The Section line gives the "section" where this Debian package is stored at the
Debian FTP sites.
</p><p>
The Priority indicates how important is this package for installation, so that
semi-intelligent software like apt or aptitude can sort the package into a
category of e.g. packages optionally installed.  See <a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#priority" title="7.7.Â What is an Essential, Required, Important, Standard, Optional, or Extra package?">SectionÂ 7.7, â€œWhat is an <span class="emphasis"><em>Essential</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Required</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Important</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Standard</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Optional</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>Extra</em></span> package?â€</a>.

The Maintainer field gives the e-mail address of the person who is currently
responsible for maintaining this package.

The Description field gives a brief summary of the package's features.

For more information about all possible fields a package can have, please see
the Debian Policy Manual, section 5, "Control files and their fields", see

</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="conffile"></a>7.5.Â What is a Debian conffile?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Conffiles is a list of configuration files (usually placed in
<code class="literal">/etc</code>) that the package management system will not overwrite
when the package is upgraded.  This ensures that local values for the contents
of these files will be preserved, and is a critical feature enabling the
in-place upgrade of packages on a running system.
</p><p>
To determine exactly which files are preserved during an upgrade, run:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --status package
</pre><p>
And look under "Conffiles:".
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="maintscripts"></a>7.6.Â What is a Debian preinst, postinst, prerm, and postrm script?</h2></div></div></div><p>
These files are executable scripts which are automatically run before or after
a package is installed or removed.  Along with a file named
<code class="literal">control</code>, all of these files are part of the "control"
section of a Debian archive file.
</p><p>
The individual files are:
</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">preinst</span></dt><dd><p>
This script is executed before the package it belongs to is unpacked from its
Debian archive (".deb") file.  Many 'preinst' scripts stop services for
packages which are being upgraded until their installation or upgrade is
completed (following the successful execution of the 'postinst' script).
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">postinst</span></dt><dd><p>
This script typically completes any required configuration of the package
<code class="literal">foo</code> once <code class="literal">foo</code> has been unpacked from its
Debian archive (".deb") file.  Often, 'postinst' scripts ask users for input,
and/or warn them that if they accept default values, they should remember to go
back and re-configure that package as needed.  Many 'postinst' scripts then
execute any commands necessary to start or restart a service once a new package
has been installed or upgraded.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">prerm</span></dt><dd><p>
This script typically stops any daemons which are associated with a package.
It is executed before the removal of files associated with the package.
</p></dd><dt><span class="term">postrm</span></dt><dd><p>
This script typically modifies links or other files associated with
<code class="literal">foo</code>, and/or removes files created by the package.  (Also see
<a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#virtual" title="7.8.Â What is a Virtual Package?">SectionÂ 7.8, â€œWhat is a Virtual Package?â€</a>.)
</p></dd></dl></div><p>
Currently all of the control files can be found in the directory
<code class="literal">/var/lib/dpkg/info</code>.  The files relevant to package
<code class="literal">foo</code> begin with the name "foo" and have file extensions of
"preinst", "postinst", etc., as appropriate.  The file
<code class="literal">foo.list</code> in that directory lists all of the files that were
installed with the package <code class="literal">foo</code>.  (Note that the location of
these files is a dpkg internal; you should not rely on it.)
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="priority"></a>7.7.Â What is an <span class="emphasis"><em>Essential</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Required</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Important</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Standard</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Optional</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>Extra</em></span> package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Each Debian package is assigned a <span class="emphasis"><em>priority</em></span> by the
distribution maintainers, as an aid to the package management system.  The
priorities are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Required</strong></span>: packages that are necessary for
the proper functioning of the system.
</p><p>
This includes all tools that are necessary to repair system defects.  You must
not remove these packages or your system may become totally broken and you may
probably not even be able to use dpkg to put things back.  Systems with only
the Required packages are probably unusable, but they do have enough
functionality to allow the sysadmin to boot and install more software.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Important</strong></span> packages should be found on any
Unix-like system.
</p><p>
Other packages which the system will not run well or be usable without will be
here.  This does <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> include Emacs or X or TeX or any
other large application.  These packages only constitute the bare
infrastructure.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Standard</strong></span> packages are standard on any Linux
system, including a reasonably small but not too limited character-mode system.
Tools are included to be able to send e-mail (with mutt) and download files
from FTP servers.
</p><p>
This is what will be installed by default if users do not select anything else.
It does not include many large applications, but it does include the Python
interpreter and some server software like OpenSSH (for remote administration)
and Exim (for mail delivery, although it can be configured for local delivery
only).  It also includes some common generic documentation that most users will
find helpful.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Optional</strong></span> packages include all those that you
might reasonably want to install if you do not know what they are, or that do
not have specialized requirements.
</p><p>
This includes X, a full TeX distribution, and lots of applications.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Extra</strong></span>: packages that either conflict with
others with higher priorities, are only likely to be useful if you already know
what they are, or have specialized requirements that make them unsuitable for
"Optional".
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you do a default Debian installation all the packages of priority <span class="strong"><strong>Standard</strong></span> or higher will be installed in your system.
If you select pre-defined tasks you will get lower priority packages too.
</p><p>
Additionally, some packages are marked as <span class="strong"><strong>Essential</strong></span> since they are absolutely necessary for the
proper functioning of the system.  The package management tools will refuse to
remove these.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="virtual"></a>7.8.Â What is a Virtual Package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
A virtual package is a generic name that applies to any one of a group of
packages, all of which provide similar basic functionality.  For example, both
the <code class="literal">konqueror</code> and <code class="literal">firefox-esr</code> programs
are web browsers, and should therefore satisfy any dependency of a program that
requires a web browser on a system, in order to work or to be useful.  They are
therefore both said to provide the "virtual package" called
<code class="literal">www-browser</code>.
</p><p>
Similarly, <code class="literal">exim4</code> and <code class="literal">sendmail</code> both
provide the functionality of a mail transport agent.  They are therefore said
to provide the virtual package "mail-transport-agent".  If either one is
installed, then any program depending on the installation of a
<code class="literal">mail-transport-agent</code> will be satisfied by the presence of
this virtual package.
</p><p>
Debian provides a mechanism so that, if more than one package which provide the
same virtual package is installed on a system, then system administrators can
set one as the preferred package.  The relevant command is
<code class="literal">update-alternatives</code>, and is described further in <a class="xref" href="customizing.en.html#diverse" title="11.11.Â Some users like mawk, others like gawk; some like vim, others like elvis; some like trn, others like tin; how does Debian support diversity?">SectionÂ 11.11, â€œSome users like mawk, others like gawk; some like vim, others like elvis; some like trn, others like tin; how does Debian support diversity?â€</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="depends"></a>7.9.Â What is meant by saying that a package <span class="emphasis"><em>Depends</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recommends</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Suggests</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Conflicts</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Replaces</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Breaks</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Provides</em></span> another package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
The Debian package system has a range of package "dependencies" which are
designed to indicate (in a single flag) the level at which Program A can
operate independently of the existence of Program B on a given system:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
Package A <span class="emphasis"><em>depends</em></span> on Package B if B absolutely must be
installed in order to run A.  In some cases, A depends not only on B, but on a
version of B.  In this case, the version dependency is usually a lower limit,
in the sense that A depends on any version of B more recent than some specified
version.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Package A <span class="emphasis"><em>recommends</em></span> Package B, if the package maintainer
judges that most users would not want A without also having the functionality
provided by B.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Package A <span class="emphasis"><em>suggests</em></span> Package B if B contains files that are
related to (and usually enhance) the functionality of A.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Package A <span class="emphasis"><em>conflicts</em></span> with Package B when A will not operate
if B is installed on the system.  Most often, conflicts are cases where A
contains files which are an improvement over those in B.  "Conflicts" are often
combined with "replaces".
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Package A <span class="emphasis"><em>replaces</em></span> Package B when files installed by B are
removed and (in some cases) over-written by files in A.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Package A <span class="emphasis"><em>breaks</em></span> Package B when both packages cannot be
simultaneously configured in a system.  The package management system will
refuse to install one if the other one is already installed and configured in
the system.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Package A <span class="emphasis"><em>provides</em></span> Package B when all of the files and
functionality of B are incorporated into A.  This mechanism provides a way for
users with constrained disk space to get only that part of package A which they
really need.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
More detailed information on the use of each of these terms can be found in the
Debian Policy manual, section 7.2, "Binary Dependencies", see <a class="xref" href="support.en.html#debiandocs" title="12.1.Â What other documentation exists on and for a Debian system?">SectionÂ 12.1, â€œWhat other documentation exists on and for a Debian system?â€</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pre-depends"></a>7.10.Â What is meant by Pre-Depends?</h2></div></div></div><p>
"Pre-Depends" is a special dependency.  In the case of most packages,
<code class="literal">dpkg</code> will unpack the archive file of a package (i.e., its
<code class="literal">.deb</code> file) independently of whether or not the files on
which it depends exist on the system.  Simplistically, unpacking means that
<code class="literal">dpkg</code> will extract the files from the archive file that were
meant to be installed on your file system, and put them in place.  If those
packages <span class="emphasis"><em>depend</em></span> on the existence of some other packages on
your system, <code class="literal">dpkg</code> will refuse to complete the installation
(by executing its "configure" action) until the other packages are installed.
</p><p>
However, for some packages, <code class="literal">dpkg</code> will refuse even to unpack
them until certain dependencies are resolved.  Such packages are said to
"Pre-depend" on the presence of some other packages.  The Debian project
provided this mechanism to support the safe upgrading of systems from
<code class="literal">a.out</code> format to <code class="literal">ELF</code> format, where the
<span class="emphasis"><em>order</em></span> in which packages were unpacked was critical.  There
are other large upgrade situations where this method is useful, e.g. the
packages with the required priority and their LibC dependency.
</p><p>
As before, more detailed information about this can be found in the Policy
manual.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pkgstatus"></a>7.11.Â What is meant by <span class="emphasis"><em>unknown</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>install</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>purge</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>hold</em></span> in the package status?</h2></div></div></div><p>
These "want" flags tell what the user wanted to do with a package (as indicated
by the user's direct invocations of
<code class="literal">dpkg</code>/<code class="literal">apt</code>/ <code class="literal">aptitude</code>).
</p><p>
Their meanings are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
unknown - the user has never indicated whether the package is wanted.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
install - the user wants the package installed or upgraded.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
remove - the user wants the package removed, but does not want to remove any
existing configuration file.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
purge - the user wants the package to be removed completely, including its
configuration files.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
hold - the user wants this package not to be processed, i.e. wants to keep the
current version with the current status whatever that is.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="puttingonhold"></a>7.12.Â How do I put a package on hold?</h2></div></div></div><p>
There are three ways of holding back packages, with dpkg, apt or aptitude.
</p><p>
With dpkg, you have to export the list of package selections, with:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --get-selections \* &gt; selections.txt
</pre><p>
Then edit the resulting file <code class="filename">selections.txt</code>, change the
line containing the package you wish to hold, e.g. <code class="systemitem">libc6</code><a id="idm1244" class="indexterm"></a>, from this:
</p><pre class="screen">
libc6                                           install
</pre><p>
to this:
</p><pre class="screen">
libc6                                           hold
</pre><p>
Save the file, and reload it into dpkg database with:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --set-selections &lt; selections.txt
</pre><p>
With apt, you can set a package to hold using
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-mark hold package_name
</pre><p>
and remove the hold with
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-mark unhold package_name
</pre><p>
With aptitude, you can hold a package using
</p><pre class="screen">
aptitude hold package_name
</pre><p>
and remove the hold with
</p><pre class="screen">
aptitude unhold package_name
</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="sourcepkgs"></a>7.13.Â How do I install a source package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Debian source packages can't actually be "installed", they are just unpacked in
whatever directory you want to build the binary packages they produce.
</p><p>
Source packages are distributed on most of the same mirrors where you can
obtain the binary packages.  If you set up your APT's
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sources.list</span>(5)</span>
to include the appropriate "deb-src" lines, you'll be able to easily download
any source package by running
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-get source foo
</pre><p>
To help you in actually building the source package, Debian source packages
provide the so-called build-dependencies mechanism.  This means that the source
package maintainer keeps a list of other packages that are required to build
their package.  To see how this is useful, run
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-get build-dep foo
</pre><p>
before building the source.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="sourcebuild"></a>7.14.Â How do I build binary packages from a source package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
The preferred way to do this is by using various wrapper tools.  We'll show how
it's done using the <code class="literal">devscripts</code> tools.  Install this package
if you haven't done so already.
</p><p>
Now, first get the source package:
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-get source foo
</pre><p>
and change to the source tree:
</p><pre class="screen">
cd foo-*
</pre><p>
Then install needed build-dependencies (if any):
</p><pre class="screen">
sudo apt-get build-dep foo
</pre><p>
Then create a dedicated version of your own build (so that you won't get
confused later when Debian itself releases a new version):
</p><pre class="screen">
dch -l local 'Blah blah blah'
</pre><p>
And finally build your package:
</p><pre class="screen">
debuild -us -uc
</pre><p>
If everything worked out fine, you should now be able to install your package
by running
</p><pre class="screen">
sudo dpkg -i ../*.deb
</pre><p>
If you prefer to do things manually, and don't want to use
<code class="literal">devscripts</code>, follow this procedure:
</p><p>
You will need all of foo_*.dsc, foo_*.tar.gz and foo_*.diff.gz to compile the
source (note: there is no .diff.gz for some packages that are native to
Debian).
</p><p>
Once you have them (<a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#sourcepkgs" title="7.13.Â How do I install a source package?">SectionÂ 7.13, â€œHow do I install a source package?â€</a>) and if you have the
<code class="systemitem">dpkg-dev</code><a id="idm1293" class="indexterm"></a> package installed, the
following command:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg-source -x foo_version-revision.dsc
</pre><p>
will extract the package into a directory called
<code class="literal">foo-version</code>.
</p><p>
If you just want to compile the package, you may cd into the
<code class="literal">foo-version</code> directory and issue the command
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b
</pre><p>
to build the package (note that this also requires the <code class="systemitem">fakeroot</code><a id="idm1304" class="indexterm"></a> package), and then
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg -i ../foo_version-revision_arch.deb
</pre><p>
to install the newly-built package(s).

Go ahead.  You do not need permission to distribute anything we have
<span class="emphasis"><em>released</em></span>, so that you can master your CD as soon as the
beta-test ends.  You do not have to pay us anything.  Of course, all CD
manufacturers must honor the licenses of the programs in Debian.  For example,
many of the programs are licensed under the GPL, which requires you to
distribute their source code.
</p><p>
Also, we will publish a list of CD manufacturers who donate money, software,
and time to the Debian project, and we will encourage users to buy from
manufacturers who donate, so it is good advertising to make donations.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="packagednonfree"></a>14.2.Â Can Debian be packaged with non-free software?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Yes.  While all the main components of Debian are free software, we provide a
non-free directory for programs that are not freely redistributable.
</p><p>
CD manufacturers <span class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be able to distribute the programs we
have placed in that directory, depending on the license terms or their private
arrangements with the authors of those software packages.  CD manufacturers can
also distribute the non-free software they get from other sources on the same
CD.  This is nothing new: free and commercial software are distributed on the
same CD by many manufacturers now.  Of course we still encourage software
authors to release the programs they write as free software.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="childistro"></a>14.3.Â I am making a special Linux distribution for a "vertical market". Can I use Debian GNU/Linux for the guts of a Linux system and add my own applications on top of it?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Yes.  Debian-derived distributions are being created both in close cooperation
with the Debian project itself and by external parties.  One can use the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/blends/" target="_top">Debian Pure Blends</a> framework to
work together with Debian; <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/" target="_top">DebianEdu/Skolelinux</a> is one
such project.
</p><p>
There are several other Debian-derived distributions already on the market,
such as grml, LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition), Knoppix and Ubuntu, that are
targeted at a different kind of audience than the original Debian GNU/Linux is,
but use most of our components in their product.
</p><p>
Debian also provides a mechanism to allow developers and system administrators
to install local versions of selected files in such a way that they will not be
overwritten when other packages are upgraded.  This is discussed further in the
question on <a class="xref" href="customizing.en.html#divert" title="11.9.Â How do I override a file installed by a package, so that a different version can be used instead?">SectionÂ 11.9, â€œHow do I override a file installed by a package, so that a different version can be used instead?â€</a>.

Go right ahead.  The package tool is free software; the packages may or may not
be free software, it can install them all.

Like most Linux distributions, Debian GNU/Linux provides:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
the major GNU applications for software development, file manipulation, and
text processing, including gcc, g++, make, texinfo, Emacs, the Bash shell and
numerous upgraded Unix utilities,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and various related programs, modules and libraries for
each of them,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
TeX (LaTeX) and Lyx, dvips, Ghostscript,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
the Xorg windowing system, which provides a networked graphical user interface
for Linux, and countless X applications including the GNOME, KDE and Xfce
desktop environments,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
a full suite of networking applications, including servers for Internet
protocols such as HTTP (WWW), FTP, NNTP (news), SMTP and POP (mail) and DNS
(name servers); relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL; also provided are
web browsers including the various Mozilla products,
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
a complete set of office applications, including the LibreOffice productivity
suite, Gnumeric and other spreadsheets, WYSIWYG editors, calendars.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
More than 57200 packages, ranging from news servers and readers to sound
support, FAX programs, database and spreadsheet programs, image processing
programs, communications, net, and mail utilities, Web servers, and even
ham-radio programs are included in the distribution.  Other 930 software suites
are available as Debian packages, but are not formally part of Debian due to
license restrictions.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="softwareauthors"></a>5.2.Â Who wrote all that software?</h2></div></div></div><p>
For each package the <span class="emphasis"><em>authors</em></span> of the program(s) are
credited in the file <code class="literal">/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/copyright</code>, where
PACKAGE is to be substituted with the package's name.
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Maintainers</em></span> who package this software for the Debian GNU/Linux
system are listed in the Debian control file (see <a class="xref" href="pkg-basics.en.html#controlfile" title="7.4.Â What is a Debian control file?">SectionÂ 7.4, â€œWhat is a Debian control file?â€</a>) that comes with each package.  The Debian changelog,
in <code class="literal">/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/changelog.Debian.gz</code>, mentions the
people who've worked on the Debian packaging too.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="pkglist"></a>5.3.Â How can I get a current list of programs that have been packaged for Debian?</h2></div></div></div><p>
A complete list is available from any of the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist" target="_top">Debian mirrors</a>, in the file
<code class="literal">indices/Maintainers</code>.  That file includes the package names
and the names and e-mails of their respective maintainers.
</p><p>
The <a class="ulink" href="https://packages.debian.org/" target="_top">WWW interface to the Debian
packages</a> conveniently summarizes the packages in each of about thirty
"sections" of the Debian archive.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="buildenv"></a>5.4.Â How can I install a developer's environment to build packages?</h2></div></div></div><p>
If you want to build packages in your Debian system you will need to have a
basic development environment, including a C/C++ compiler and some other
essential packages.  In order to install this environment you just need to
install the <code class="systemitem">build-essential</code><a id="idm561" class="indexterm"></a> package.
This is a meta-package or place-holder package which depends on the standard
development tools one needs to build a Debian package.
</p><p>
Some software can, however, need additional software to be rebuilt, including
library headers or additional tools such as <span class="command"><strong>autoconf</strong></span> or
<span class="command"><strong>gettext</strong></span>.  Debian provides many of the tools needed to build
other software as Debian packages.
</p><p>
Finding which software is precisely required can be tricky, however, unless you
are planning on rebuilding Debian packages.  This last task is rather easy to
do, as official packages have to include a list of the additional software
(besides the packages in <code class="systemitem">build-essential</code><a id="idm569" class="indexterm"></a>) needed to build the package, this
is known as <code class="literal">Build-Dependencies</code>.  To install all the packages
needed to build a given source package and then build said source package you
can just run:
</p><pre class="screen">
# apt-get build-dep <em class="replaceable"><code>foo</code></em>
# apt-get source --build <em class="replaceable"><code>foo</code></em>
</pre><p>
Notice that if you want to build the Linux kernels distributed by Debian you
will want to install also the <code class="systemitem">kernel-package</code><a id="idm578" class="indexterm"></a> package.  For more information see
<a class="xref" href="kernel.en.html#customkernel" title="10.2.Â What tools does Debian provide to build custom kernels?">SectionÂ 10.2, â€œWhat tools does Debian provide to build custom kernels?â€</a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="missing"></a>5.5.Â What is missing from Debian GNU/Linux?</h2></div></div></div><p>
There is a list of packages which still need to be packaged for Debian, the
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/" target="_top">Work-Needing and Prospective
Packages list</a>.
</p><p>
For more details about adding missing things, see <a class="xref" href="contributing.en.html" title="ChapterÂ 13.Â Contributing to the Debian Project">ChapterÂ 13, <em>Contributing to the Debian Project</em></a>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="no-devs"></a>5.6.Â Why do I get "ld: cannot find -lfoo" messages when compiling programs? Why aren't there any libfoo.so files in Debian library packages?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Debian Policy requires that such symbolic links (to libfoo.so.x.y.z or similar)
are placed in separate, development packages.  Those packages are usually named
libfoo-dev or libfooX-dev (presuming the library package is named libfooX, and
X is a whole number).
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="java"></a>5.7.Â (How) Does Debian support Java?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Several <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> implementations of Java technology are
available as Debian packages, providing both Java Development Kits as well as
Runtime Environments.  You can write, debug and run Java programs using Debian.
</p><p>
Running a Java applet requires a web browser with the capability to recognize
and execute it.  Several web browsers available in Debian, such as Mozilla or
Konqueror, support Java plug-ins that enable running Java applets within them.
</p><p>
Please refer to the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-java-faq/" target="_top">Debian Java
FAQ</a> for more information.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="isitdebian"></a>5.8.Â How can I check that I am using a Debian system, and what version it is?</h2></div></div></div><p>
In order to make sure that your system has been installed from the real Debian
base disks, use the
</p><pre class="screen">
lsb_release -a
</pre><p>
command.  It will display the name of the distribution (in Distributor ID
field) and the version of the system (in Release and Codename fields).  The
following is an example run in a Debian system:
</p><pre class="screen">
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux 7.4 (wheezy)
Release:    7.4
Codename:   wheezy
</pre><p>
You can also check for the existence of <code class="literal">/etc/debian_version</code>
file, which contains a single one-line entry giving the version number of the
release, as defined by the package <code class="literal">base-files</code>.
</p><p>
Users should be aware, however, that the Debian system consists of many parts,
each of which can be updated (almost) independently.  Each Debian "release"
contains well defined and unchanging contents.  Updates are separately
available.  For a one-line description of the installation status of package
<code class="literal">foo</code>, use the command <code class="literal">dpkg --list foo</code>.
For a more verbose description, use:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg --status foo
</pre><p>
To view versions of all installed packages, run:
</p><pre class="screen">
dpkg -l
</pre><p>
Note that the existence of the program <code class="literal">dpkg</code> shows that you
should be able to install Debian packages on your system.  However, since the
program has been ported to many other operating systems and architectures, this
is no longer a reliable method of determining if a system is Debian GNU/Linux.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="nonenglish"></a>5.9.Â How does Debian support non-English languages?</h2></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
Debian GNU/Linux is distributed with keymaps for nearly two dozen keyboards,
and with utilities (in the <code class="literal">kbd</code> package) to install, view,
and modify the tables.
</p><p>
The installation prompts the user to specify the keyboard he will use.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Nearly all of the software in Debian supports UTF-8 as character set.  Legacy
character sets, such as ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-2, should be considered
obsolete.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Currently, support for German-, Spanish-, French-, Hungarian-, Italian-,
Japanese-, Korean-, Dutch-, Polish-, Portuguese-, Russian-, Turkish-, and
Chinese-language manual pages is provided through the
<code class="literal">manpages-LANG</code> packages (where LANG is the two-letter ISO
country code).  To access an NLS manual page, the user must set the shell
LC_MESSAGES variable to the appropriate string.
</p><p>
For example, in the case of the Italian-language manual pages, LC_MESSAGES
needs to be set to 'italian'.  The <span class="command"><strong>man</strong></span> program will then
search for Italian manual pages under <code class="literal">/usr/share/man/it/</code>.

The Debian GNU/Linux reference covers many aspects of system administration
through shell-command examples.  Basic tutorials, tips, and other information
are provided for many different topics ranging from system administration to
programming.
</p><p>
Get it from the <code class="systemitem">debian-reference</code><a id="idm2095" class="indexterm"></a>

The Debian Policy manual documents the policy requirements for the

Documentation developed by the Debian Documentation Project.  It is available
at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/doc" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/doc</a>
and includes user guides, administration guides and security guides for the
Debian GNU/Linux operating system.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Documentation on installed Debian packages: Most packages have files that are
unpacked into <code class="literal">/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Documentation on the Linux project: The Debian package <code class="systemitem">doc-linux</code><a id="idm2116" class="indexterm"></a> installs all of the most recent versions
of the HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tldp.org/" target="_top">Linux
Documentation Project</a>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Unix-style `man' pages: Most commands have manual pages written in the style of
the original Unix 'man' files.  For instance, to see the manual page for the
command `ls', execute <code class="literal">man ls</code>.  Execute <code class="literal">man
man</code> for more information on finding and viewing manual pages.
</p><p>
New Debian users should note that the 'man' pages of many general system
commands are not available until they install these packages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem"><p>
<code class="literal">man-db</code>, which contains the <code class="literal">man</code> program
itself, and other programs for manipulating the manual pages.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<code class="literal">manpages</code>, which contains the system manual pages.  (see
<a class="xref" href="software.en.html#nonenglish" title="5.9.Â How does Debian support non-English languages?">SectionÂ 5.9, â€œHow does Debian support non-English languages?â€</a>).
</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>
GNU-style `info' pages: User documentation for many commands, particularly GNU
tools, is available not in `man' pages, but in `info' files which can be read
by the GNU tool <code class="literal">info</code>, by running <code class="literal">M-x info</code>
within GNU Emacs, or with some other Info page viewer.
</p><p>
Its main advantage over the original `man' pages is that it is a hypertext
system.  It does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> require the WWW, however;
<code class="literal">info</code> can be run from a plain text console.  It was designed
by Richard Stallman and preceded the WWW.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that you may access a lot of documentation on your system by using a WWW
browser, through `dwww', `dhelp' or `doccentral' commands, found in respective
packages, or by using `yelp'.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="onlineresources"></a>12.2.Â Are there any on-line resources for discussing Debian?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Yes.  In fact, the main method of support Debian provides to our users is by
the way of e-mail.  We'll give some details on that, and mention some other
useful resources.  Even more resources are listed at the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/support" target="_top">Debian Support webpage</a>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="s12.2.1"></a>12.2.1.Â Mailing lists</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are a lot of <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/" target="_top">Debian-related mailing lists</a>.
</p><p>
On a system with the <code class="systemitem">doc-debian</code><a id="idm2152" class="indexterm"></a> package
installed there is a complete list of mailing lists in
<code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/debian/mailing-lists.txt</code>.
</p><p>
Debian mailing lists are named following the pattern
debian-<em class="replaceable"><code>list-subject</code></em>.  Examples are debian-announce,
debian-user, debian-news.  To subscribe to any list
debian-<em class="replaceable"><code>list-subject</code></em>, send mail to
debian-<em class="replaceable"><code>list-subject</code></em>-request@lists.debian.org with
the word "subscribe" in the Subject: header.  Be sure to remember to add
<span class="emphasis"><em>-request</em></span> to the e-mail address when using this method to
subscribe or unsubscribe.  Otherwise your e-mail will go to the list itself,
which could be embarrassing or annoying, depending on your point of view.
</p><p>
You can subscribe to mailing lists using the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe" target="_top">WWW form</a>.  You can
also un-subscribe using a <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/unsubscribe" target="_top">WWW form</a>.
</p><p>
The list manager's e-mail address is
<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</a>&gt;</code>, in case you have any trouble.
</p><p>
The mailing lists are public forums.  All e-mails sent to the lists are also
copied to the public archive, for anybody (even non-subscribers) to browse or
search.  Please make sure you never send any confidential or unlicensed
material to the lists.  This includes things like e-mail addresses.  Of
particular note is the fact that spammers have been known to abuse e-mail
addresses posted to our mailing lists.  See the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/#disclaimer" target="_top">Mailing Lists Privacy
policy</a> for more information.
</p><p>
Archives of the Debian mailing lists are available via WWW at <a class="ulink" href="https://lists.debian.org/" target="_top">https://lists.debian.org/</a>.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="mailinglistconduct"></a>12.2.1.1.Â What is the code of conduct for the mailing lists?</h4></div></div></div><p>
When using the Debian mailing lists, please follow these rules:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
Do not send spam.  See the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/#ads" target="_top">Debian mailing list advertising
policy</a>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Do not flame; it is not polite.  The people developing Debian are all
volunteers, donating their time, energy and money in an attempt to bring the
Debian project together.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Do not use foul language; besides, some people receive the lists via packet
radio, where swearing is illegal.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Make sure that you are using the proper list.  <span class="emphasis"><em>Never</em></span> post
your (un)subscription requests to the mailing list itself.<a href="#ftn.idm2184" class="footnote" id="idm2184"><sup class="footnote">[7]</sup></a>

<a class="ulink" href="https://debianhelp.org/" target="_top">debianHELP</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://forums.debian.net/" target="_top">Debian User Forums</a> are web forums on
which you can submit questions about Debian and have them answered by other

</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="s12.2.4"></a>12.2.4.Â Maintainers</h3></div></div></div><p>
Users can address questions to individual package maintainers using e-mail.  To
reach a maintainer of a package called xyz, send e-mail to
<span class="emphasis"><em>xyz@packages.debian.org</em></span>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="s12.2.5"></a>12.2.5.Â Usenet newsgroups</h3></div></div></div><p>
Users should post non-Debian-specific questions to one of the Linux USENET
groups, which are named comp.os.linux.* or linux.*.  There are several lists of
Linux Usenet newsgroups and other related resources on the WWW, e.g. on the
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.linux.org/docs/usenet.html" target="_top">Linux Online</a> and
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/helpdesk.php" target="_top">LinuxJournal</a>
sites.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="searchtools"></a>12.3.Â Is there a quick way to search for information on Debian GNU/Linux?</h2></div></div></div><p>
There is a variety of search engines that serve documentation related to
Debian:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
<a class="ulink" href="https://search.debian.org/" target="_top">Debian WWW search site</a>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<a class="ulink" href="https://groups.google.com/" target="_top">Google Groups</a>: a search engine
for newsgroups.
</p><p>
For example, to find out what experiences people have had with finding drivers
for NVIDIA graphic cards under Debian, try searching the phrase <code class="literal">NVIDIA
Linux driver</code>.  This will show you all the posts that contain these
strings, i.e. those where people discussed these topics.  If you add
<code class="literal">Debian</code> to those search strings, you'll also get the posts
specifically related to Debian.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Any of the common web spidering engines, such as <a class="ulink" href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_top">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a class="ulink" href="https://www.google.com/" target="_top">Google</a>, as long as you use the right
search terms.
</p><p>
For example, searching on the string "evince" gives a more detailed explanation
of this package than the brief description field in its control file.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="buglogs"></a>12.4.Â Are there logs of known bugs?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Reports on unsolved (and closed) issues are publicly available: Debian
promissed to do so by stating "We will not hide problems" in the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract" target="_top">Debian Social Contract</a>.
</p><p>
The Debian GNU/Linux distribution has a bug tracking system (BTS) which files
details of bugs reported by users and developers.  Each bug is given a number,
and is kept on file.  Once it has been dealt with, it is marked as such.
</p><p>
Copies of this information are available at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/Bugs/" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/Bugs/</a>.
</p><p>
A mail server provides access to the bug tracking system database via e-mail.
In order to get the instructions, send an e-mail to request@bugs.debian.org
with "help" in the body.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="bugreport"></a>12.5.Â How do I report a bug in Debian?</h2></div></div></div><p>
If you have found a bug in Debian, please read the instructions for reporting a
bug in Debian.  These instructions can be obtained in one of several ways:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
From the WWW.  A copy of the instructions is shown at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting</a>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
On any Debian system with the <code class="systemitem">doc-debian</code><a id="idm2244" class="indexterm"></a> package installed.  The instructions are
in the file <code class="filename">/usr/share/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt</code>.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
By anonymous FTP.  Debian mirror sites contain the instructions in the file
<code class="literal">doc/bug-reporting.txt</code>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can use the package <code class="systemitem">reportbug</code><a id="idm2253" class="indexterm"></a> that
will guide you through the reporting process and mail the message to the proper
address, with some extra details about your system added automatically.  It
will also show you a list of bugs already reported to the package you are
reporting against in case your bug has been reported previously, so that you
can add additional information to the existing bug report.
</p><p>
Expect to get an automatic acknowledgement of your bug report.  It will also be
automatically given a bug tracking number, entered into the bug log and
forwarded to the debian-bugs-dist mailing list.

One of Debian's goals is to provide a consistent upgrade path and a secure
upgrade process.  We always do our best to make upgrading to new releases a
smooth procedure.  In case there's some important note to add to the upgrade
process, the packages will alert the user, and often provide a solution to a
possible problem.
</p><p>
You should also read the Release Notes document that describes the details of
specific upgrades.  It is available on the Debian website at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes</a>
and is also shipped on the Debian CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray discs.
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="howtocurrent"></a>9.1.Â How can I keep my Debian system current?</h2></div></div></div><p>
One could simply execute an anonymous ftp call to a Debian archive, then peruse
the directories until one finds the desired file, and then fetch it, and
finally install it using <code class="literal">dpkg</code>.  Note that
<code class="literal">dpkg</code> will install upgrade files in place, even on a running
system.  Sometimes, a revised package will require the installation of a newly
revised version of another package, in which case the installation will fail
until/unless the other package is installed.
</p><p>
Many people find this approach much too time-consuming, since Debian evolves so
quickly -- typically, a dozen or more new packages are uploaded every week.
This number is larger just before a new major release.  To deal with this
avalanche, many people prefer to use a more automated method.  Several
different packages are available for this purpose:
</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="aptitude-upgrade"></a>9.1.1.Â aptitude</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> is the recommended package manager for Debian GNU/Linux
systems, and is described in <a class="xref" href="pkgtools.en.html#aptitude" title="8.1.3.Â aptitude">SectionÂ 8.1.3, â€œaptitudeâ€</a>.
</p><p>
Before you can use <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> to make an upgrade, you'll have
to edit the <code class="literal">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to set it up.  If you
wish to upgrade to the latest stable version of Debian, you'll probably want to
use a source like this one:
</p><pre class="screen">
http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib
</pre><p>
You can replace ftp.us.debian.org (the mirror in the United States) with the
name of a faster Debian mirror near you.  See the mirror list at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/mirror/list" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/mirror/list</a>
for more information.
</p><p>
Or you can use the redirector service httpredir.debian.org which aims to solve
the problem of choosing a Debian mirror.  It uses the geographic location of
the user and other information to choose the best mirror that can serve the
files.  To take advantage of it use a source like this one:
</p><pre class="screen">
http://httpredir.debian.org/debian stable main contrib
</pre><p>
More details on this can be found in the
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sources.list</span>(5)</span>
manual page.
</p><p>
To update your system from the command line, run
</p><pre class="screen">
aptitude update
</pre><p>
followed by
</p><pre class="screen">
aptitude full-upgrade
</pre><p>
Answer any questions that might come up, and your system will be upgraded.
</p><p>
Note that <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> is not the recommended tool for doing
upgrades from one Debian GNU/Linux release to another.  Use
<span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span> instead.  For upgrades between releases you should
read the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/releasenotes" target="_top">Release Notes</a>.
This document describes in detail the recommended steps for upgrades from
previous releases as well as known issues you should consider before upgrading.
</p><p>
For details, see the manual page
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">aptitude</span>(8)</span>,
and the file <code class="filename">/usr/share/aptitude/README</code>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="apt"></a>9.1.2.Â apt-get and apt-cdrom</h3></div></div></div><p>
An alternative to <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> is <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>
which is an APT-based command-line tool (described previously in <a class="xref" href="pkgtools.en.html#apt-get" title="8.1.2.Â APT">SectionÂ 8.1.2, â€œAPTâ€</a>).
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>, the APT-based command-line tool for handling
packages, provides a simple, safe way to install and upgrade packages.
</p><p>
To use <span class="command"><strong>apt-get</strong></span>, edit the
<code class="literal">/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to set it up, just as for <a class="xref" href="uptodate.en.html#aptitude-upgrade" title="9.1.1.Â aptitude">SectionÂ 9.1.1, â€œaptitudeâ€</a>.
</p><p>
Then run
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-get update
</pre><p>
followed by
</p><pre class="screen">
apt-get dist-upgrade
</pre><p>
Answer any questions that might come up, and your system will be upgraded.  See
also the
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">apt-get</span>(8)</span>
manual page, as well as <a class="xref" href="pkgtools.en.html#apt-get" title="8.1.2.Â APT">SectionÂ 8.1.2, â€œAPTâ€</a>.
</p><p>
If you want to use CDs/DVDs/BDs to install packages, you can use
<span class="command"><strong>apt-cdrom</strong></span>.  For details, please see the Release Notes,
section "Adding APT sources from optical media".
</p><p>
Please note that when you get and install the packages, you'll still have them
kept in your /var directory hierarchy.  To keep your partition from
overflowing, remember to delete extra files using <code class="literal">apt-get
clean</code> and <code class="literal">apt-get autoclean</code>, or to move them
someplace else (hint: use <code class="systemitem">apt-move</code><a id="idm1712" class="indexterm"></a>).
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="mirror"></a>9.1.3.Â mirror</h3></div></div></div><p>
This Perl script, and its (optional) manager program called
<span class="command"><strong>mirror-master</strong></span>, can be used to fetch user-specified parts of
a directory tree from a specified host <span class="emphasis"><em>via</em></span> anonymous FTP.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>mirror</strong></span> is particularly useful for downloading large volumes
of software.  After the first time files have been downloaded from a site, a
file called <code class="literal">.mirrorinfo</code> is stored on the local host.
Changes to the remote file system are tracked automatically by
<span class="command"><strong>mirror</strong></span>, which compares this file to a similar file on the
remote system and downloads only changed files.
</p><p>
The <span class="command"><strong>mirror</strong></span> program is generally useful for updating local
copies of remote directory trees.  The files fetched need not be Debian files.
(Since <span class="command"><strong>mirror</strong></span> is a Perl script, it can also run on non-Unix
systems.) Though the <span class="command"><strong>mirror</strong></span> program provides mechanisms for
excluding files with names matching user-specified strings, this program is
most useful when the objective is to download whole directory trees, rather
than selected packages.
</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="upgradesingle"></a>9.2.Â Must I go into single user mode in order to upgrade a package?</h2></div></div></div><p>
No.  Packages can be upgraded in place, even in running systems.  Debian has a
<code class="literal">start-stop-daemon</code> program that is invoked to stop, then
restart running process if necessary during a package upgrade.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="savedebs"></a>9.3.Â Do I have to keep all those .deb archive files on my disk?</h2></div></div></div><p>
No.  If you have downloaded the files to your disk then after you have
installed the packages, you can remove them from your system, e.g. by running
<code class="literal">aptitude clean</code>.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="keepingalog"></a>9.4.Â How can I keep a log of the packages I added to the system? I'd like to know when upgrades and removals have occurred and on which packages!</h2></div></div></div><p>
Passing the <code class="literal">--log</code>-option to <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> makes
<span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> log status change updates and actions.  It logs both
the <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span>-invokation (e.g.
</p><pre class="screen">
2005-12-30 18:10:33 install hello 1.3.18 2.1.1-4
</pre><p>
) and the results (e.g.
</p><pre class="screen">
2005-12-30 18:10:35 status installed hello 2.1.1-4
</pre><p>
) If you'd like to log all your <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> invocations (even those
done using frontends like <span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span>), you could add
</p><pre class="screen">
log /var/log/dpkg.log
</pre><p>
to your <code class="filename">/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg</code>.  Be sure the created logfile
gets rotated periodically.  If you're using <span class="command"><strong>logrotate</strong></span>, this
can be achieved by creating a file <code class="filename">/etc/logrotate.d/dpkg</code>
with the following lines
</p><pre class="screen">
/var/log/dpkg {
  missingok
  notifempty
}
</pre><p>
More details on <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> logging can be found in the
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">dpkg</span>(1)</span>
manual page.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>aptitude</strong></span> logs the package installations, removals, and
upgrades that it intends to perform to <code class="filename">/var/log/aptitude</code>.
Note that the <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span> of those actions are not recorded in
this file!
</p><p>
Another way to record your actions is to run your package management session
within the
<span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">script</span>(1)</span>
program.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="autoupdate"></a>9.5.Â Can I automatically update the system?</h2></div></div></div><p>
Yes.  You can use <span class="command"><strong>cron-apt</strong></span>; this tool updates the system at
regular intervals using a cron job.  By default it just updates the package
list and downloads new packages, but without installing them.
</p><p>
Note: Automatic upgrade of packages is <span class="strong"><strong>NOT</strong></span>
recommended in <span class="emphasis"><em>testing</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>unstable</em></span>
systems as this might bring unexpected behaviour and remove packages without
notice.
</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="aptcacher"></a>9.6.Â I have several machines; how can I download the updates only one time?</h2></div></div></div><p>
If you have more than one Debian machine on your network, it is useful to use
<span class="command"><strong>apt-cacher</strong></span> to keep all of your Debian systems up-to-date.
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>apt-cacher</strong></span> reduces the bandwidth requirements of Debian
mirrors by restricting the frequency of Packages, Releases and Sources file
updates from the back end and only doing a single fetch for any file,
independently of the actual request from the proxy.
<span class="command"><strong>apt-cacher</strong></span> automatically builds a Debian HTTP mirror based
on requests which pass through the proxy.
</p><p>
Of course, you can get the same benefit if you are already using a standard
caching proxy and all your systems are configured to use it.

                  ========================================

  Debian is developed through distributed development all
  around the world. Therefore, email is the preferred way to discuss
  various items. Much of the conversation between Debian developers
  and users is managed through several mailing lists.  

  There are many world-open mailing lists, meaning anyone can read
  everything that is posted, and participate in the discussions. Everyone is
  encouraged to help development of Debian and to spread the word of free
  software.  There are also a few lists which are only open to official Debian
  developers; please don't interpret this as closed development, it sometimes
  doesn't make much sense discussing internal topics with non-developers.

  All original Debian mailing lists run on a special server, using an
  automatic mail processing software called SmartList.  This server is called
  lists.debian.org.  All submission, subscription and unsubscription messages
  have to be sent to a particular address at this host.

  The language used on all lists is English, unless stated otherwise.
  There are some user lists for other languages available.

Subscription / Unsubscription
-----------------------------

  Anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe on their own to any mailing list,
  presuming the subscription policy for a particular list is `open'.

  The requests for subscription or unsubscription can be sent to a special
  control address, which is slightly different from the list address.
  Subscription or unsubscription messages should NOT be sent to the address
  of the mailing list itself.

  To subscribe or unsubscribe from a mailing list, please send mail to

        <listname>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org

  with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as subject.

  Please remember the -REQUEST part of the address.

  As part of the subscription process, the list software will send you an
  email to which you must reply in order to finish subscribing.  This is a
  security measure to keep people from subscribing others to the lists without
  their permission.

  If you need to contact a human listmaster, direct your mail to
  listmaster@lists.debian.org . To find out who is responsible for the
  lists, take a look at https://www.debian.org/intro/organization

User lists

  There are several user based mailing lists where developers and
  users can get in contact to discuss and solve problems.

  debian-announce@lists.debian.org
