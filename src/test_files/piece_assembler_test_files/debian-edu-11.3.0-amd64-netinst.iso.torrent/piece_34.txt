et
          in the package (for whatever reason: perhaps it is too
          complicated to backport the change or too minor to be worth
          bothering).

   fixed-in-experimental
          The bug has been fixed in the package of the experimental
          distribution, but not yet in the unstable distribution.

   d-i
          This bug is relevant to the development of debian-installer. It
          is expected that this will be used when the bug affects
          installer development but is not filed against a package that
          forms a direct part of the installer itself.

   ipv6
          This bug affects support for Internet Protocol version 6.

   lfs
          This bug affects support for large files (over 2 gigabytes).

   l10n
          This bug is relevant to the localisation of the package.

   a11y
          This bug is relevant to the accessibility of the package.

   ftbfs
          The package fails to build from source. If the bug is assigned
          to a source package, that package fails to build. If the bug is
          assigned to a binary package, the affected source packages fail
          to build. The tag is applicable to non-standard build
          environments (e.g. using Build-Depends from experimental), but
          the severity should be below serious (release critical) in such
          cases.

   potato, woody, sarge, etch, lenny, squeeze, wheezy, jessie, stretch,
          buster, bullseye, bookworm, trixie, sid, experimental
          These are release tags, which have two effects. When set on a
          bug, the bug can only affect the particular release (though it
          may also affect other releases if other release tags are set)
          but otherwise normal buggy/fixed/absent rules apply. The bug
          also should not be archived until it is fixed in the release.

   sarge-ignore, etch-ignore, lenny-ignore, squeeze-ignore, wheezy-ignore,
          jessie-ignore, stretch-ignore, buster-ignore, bullseye-ignore,
          bookworm-ignore, trixie-ignore
          This release-critical bug is to be ignored for the purposes of
          releasing the particular release. These tags should only be used
          by the release manager(s); do not set it yourself without
          explicit authorization from them.

   Some info on distribution-specific tags: the -ignore tags ignore the
   bug for the purposes of testing propagation. The release tags indicate
   that the bug in question should not be archived until it is fixed in
   the set of releases specified. The release tags also indicate that a
   bug should only be considered buggy in the set of releases specified.
   [In other words, the bug is absent in any release whose corresponding
   release tag is not set if any release tags are set; otherwise the
   normal found/fixed rules apply.]

   Release tags should not be used if proper versioning of the bug would
   achieve the desired effect, as they require manual addition and
   removal. If you are unsure if a release tag is required, contact the
   Debian BTS Administrators (owner@bugs.debian.org) or the release team
   for advice.

Recording that you have passed on a bug report

   When a developer forwards a bug report to the developer of the upstream
   source package from which the Debian package is derived, they should
   note this in the bug tracking system as follows:

   Make sure that the To field of your message to the author has only the
   author(s) address(es) in it; put the person who reported the bug,
   nnn-forwarded@bugs.debian.org and nnn@bugs.debian.org in the CC field.

   Ask the author to preserve the CC to nnn-forwarded@bugs.debian.org when
   they reply, so that the bug tracking system will file their reply with
   the original report. These messages are only filed and are not sent on;
   to send a message as normal, send them to nnn@bugs.debian.org as well.

   When the bug tracking system gets a message at nnn-forwarded it will
   mark the relevant bug as having been forwarded to the address(es) in
   the To field of the message it gets, if the bug is not already marked
   as forwarded.

   You can also manipulate the "forwarded to" information by sending
   messages to control@bugs.debian.org.

Changing bug ownership

   In cases where the person responsible for fixing a bug is not the
   assigned maintainer for the associated package (for example, when the
   package is maintained by a team), it may be useful to record this fact
   in the bug tracking system. To help with this, each bug may optionally
   have an owner.

   The owner can be set by supplying an Owner line in the pseudo-header
   when the bug is submitted (see the instructions for reporting bugs), or
   by using the owner and noowner commands with the control request
   server.

Incorrectly listed package maintainers

   If the maintainer of a package is listed incorrectly, this is usually
   because the maintainer has changed recently, and the new maintainer
   hasn't yet uploaded a new version of the package with a changed
   Maintainer control file field. This will be fixed when the package is
   uploaded; alternatively, the archive maintainers can override the
   maintainer record of a package manually, for example if a rebuild and
   reupload of the package is not expected to be needed soon. Contact
   override-change@debian.org for changes to the override file.

Reopening, reassigning and manipulating bugs

   It is possible to reassign bug reports to other packages, to reopen
   erroneously-closed ones, to modify the information saying to where, if
   anywhere, a bug report has been forwarded, to change the severities and
   titles of reports, to set the ownership of bugs, to merge and unmerge
   bug reports, and to record the versions of packages in which bugs were
   found and in which they were fixed. This is done by sending mail to
   control@bugs.debian.org.

   The format of these messages is described in another document available
   on the World Wide Web or in the file bug-maint-mailcontrol.txt. A plain
   text version can also be obtained by mailing the word help to the
   server at the address above.

Subscribing to bugs

   The bug tracking system also allows bug submitters, developers and
   other interested third parties to subscribe to individual bugs. This
   feature can be used by those wishing to keep an eye on a bug, without
   having to subscribe to a package through the Debian Package Tracker.
   All messages that are received at nnn@bugs.debian.org, are sent to
   subscribers.

   Subscribing to a bug can be done by sending an email to
   nnn-subscribe@bugs.debian.org. The subject and body of the email are
   ignored by the BTS. Once this message is processed, users are sent a
   confirmation message that they will need to reply to before they are
   sent the messages relating to that bug.

   It is also possible to unsubscribe from a bug. Unsubscribing can be
   done by sending an email to nnn-unsubscribe@bugs.debian.org. The
   subject and body of the email are again ignored by the BTS. Users will
   be sent a confirmation message which they must reply to if they wish to
   be unsubscribed from the bug.

   By default, the address subscribed is the one found in the From header.
   If you wish to subscribe another address to a bug, you will need to
   encode the address to be subscribed into the subscription message. This
   takes the form of: nnn-subscribe-localpart=example.com@bugs.debian.org.
   That example would send localpart@example.com a subscription message
   for bug nnn. The @ sign must be encoded by changing it to an = sign.
   Similarly, an unsubscription takes the form
   nnn-unsubscribe-localpart=example.com@bugs.debian.org. In both cases,
   the subject and body of the email will be forwarded to the email
   address within the request for confirmation.

More-or-less obsolete subject-scanning feature

   Messages that arrive at submit or bugs whose Subject starts Bug#nnn
   will be treated as having been sent to nnn@bugs.debian.org. This is
   both for backwards compatibility with mail forwarded from the old
   addresses, and to catch followup mail sent to submit by mistake (for
   example, by using reply to all recipients).

   A similar scheme operates for maintonly, done, quiet and forwarded,
   which treat mail arriving with a Subject tag as having been sent to the
   corresponding nnn-whatever@bugs.debian.org address.

   Messages arriving at plain forwarded and done — ie, with no bug report
   number in the address — and without a bug number in the Subject will be
   filed under "junk" and kept for a few weeks, but otherwise ignored.

Obsolete X-Debian-PR: quiet feature

   It used to be possible to prevent the bug tracking system from
   forwarding anywhere messages it received at debian-bugs, by putting an
   X-Debian-PR: quiet line in the actual mail header.

   This header line is now ignored. Instead, send your message to quiet or
   nnn-quiet (or maintonly or nnn-maintonly).

   Debian bug tracking system / Debian BTS — control server

Introduction to the bug control and manipulation mailserver

   Just as request@bugs.debian.org allows the retrieval of bug data and
   documentation by email, control@bugs.debian.org allows bug reports to
   be manipulated in various ways.

   The control server works just like the request server, except that it
   has some additional commands; in fact, it's the same program. The two
   addresses are only separated to avoid users making mistakes and causing
   problems while merely trying to request information.

   Since the commands specific to the control server actually change the
   status of a bug, a notification about processing the commands is sent
   to the maintainer of the package(s) the changed bugs are assigned to.
   Additionally the mail to the server and the resulting changes are
   logged in the bug report and thereby available in the WWW pages.

   Please see the introduction to the request server available on the
   World Wide Web, in the file bug-log-mailserver.txt, or by sending help
   to either mailserver, for details of the basics of operating the
   mailservers and the common commands available when mailing either
   address.

   The reference card for the mailservers is available via the WWW, in
   bug-mailserver-refcard.txt or by email using the refcard command.

   reassign bugnumber package [ version ]
          Records that bug #bugnumber is a bug in package. This can be
          used to set the package if the user forgot the pseudo-header, or
          to change an earlier assignment. No notifications are sent to
          anyone (other than the usual information in the processing
          transcript).

          If you supply a version, the bug tracking system will note that
          the bug affects that version of the newly-assigned package.

          You can assign a bug to two packages at once by separating the
          package names with a comma. However, you should only do this if
          the bug can be fixed by a change to either package. If this is
          not the case, you should clone the bug and reassign the clone to
          the other package.

   reopen bugnumber [ originator-address | = | ! ]
          Reopens #bugnumber and clears all fixed versions if it is
          closed.

          By default, or if you specify =, the original submitter is still
          as the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack
          when it is closed again.

          If you supply an originator-address the originator will be set
          to the address you supply. If you wish to become the new
          originator of the reopened report you can use the ! shorthand or
          specify your own email address.

          It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
          recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so
          that they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it
          is closed again.

          If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
          change the originator. To change the originator of an open bug
          report, use the submitter command; note that this will inform
          the original submitter of the change.

          If the bug was recorded as being closed in a particular version
          of a package but recurred in a later version, it is better to
          use the found command instead.

   found bugnumber [ version ]
          Record that #bugnumber has been encountered in the given version
          of the package to which it is assigned. version may be a fully
          qualified version, of the form sourcepackagename/version.

          The bug tracking system uses this information, in conjunction
          with fixed versions recorded when closing bugs, to display lists
          of bugs open in various versions of each package. It considers a
          bug to be open when it has no fixed version, or when it has been
          found more recently than it has been fixed.

          If no version is given, then the list of fixed versions for the
          bug is cleared. This is identical to the behaviour of reopen.
          version may be a fully qualified version, of the form
          sourcepackagename/version.

          This command will only cause a bug to be marked as not done if
          no version is specified, or if the version being marked found is
          equal to or greater than the highest version marked fixed. (If
          you are certain that you want the bug marked as not done, use
          reopen in conjunction with found.)

          This command was introduced in preference to reopen because it
          was difficult to add a version to that command's syntax without
          suffering ambiguity.

   notfound bugnumber version
          Remove the record that #bugnumber was encountered in the given
          version of the package to which it is assigned. version may be a
          fully qualified version, of the form sourcepackagename/version.

          This differs from closing the bug at that version in that the
          bug is not listed as fixed in that version either; no
          information about that version will be known. It is intended for
          fixing mistakes in the record of when a bug was found.

   fixed bugnumber version
          Indicate that bug #bugnumber was fixed in the given version of
          the package to which it is assigned. version may be a fully
          qualified version, of the form sourcepackagename/version.

          This does not cause the bug to be marked as closed, it merely
          adds another version in which the bug was fixed. Use the
          bugnumber-done address to close a bug and mark it fixed in a
          particular version.

   notfixed bugnumber version
          Remove the record that bug #bugnumber has been fixed in the
          given version. version may be a fully qualified version, of the
          form sourcepackagename/version.

          This command is equivalent to found followed by notfound (the
          found removes the fixed at a particular version, and notfound
          removes the found) with the exception that the bug is not
          reopened if the found version is greater than any existing fixed
          version. It is intended for fixing mistakes in the record of
          when a bug was fixed; in most cases, you actually want found,
          not notfixed.

   submitter bugnumber originator-address | !
          Changes the originator of #bugnumber to originator-address.

          If you wish to become the new originator of the report you can
          use the ! shorthand or specify your own email address.

          While the reopen command changes the originator of other bugs
          merged with the one being reopened, submitter does not affect
          merged bugs.

   forwarded bugnumber address
          Notes that bugnumber has been forwarded to the upstream
          maintainer at address. This does not actually forward the
          report. This can be used to change an existing incorrect
          forwarded-to address, or to record a new one for a bug that
          wasn't previously noted as having been forwarded. address should
          generally be a URI, or possibly an email address. Using a URI
          where possible allows tools to query a remote bug tracking
          system (such as bugzilla) for a bug's status.

          Example usage:

      forwarded 12345 http://bugz.illa.foo/cgi/54321

   notforwarded bugnumber
          Forgets any idea that bugnumber has been forwarded to any
          upstream maintainer. If the bug was not recorded as having been
          forwarded then this will do nothing.

   retitle bugnumber new-title
          Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default
          is the Subject mail header from the original report). Will also
          change the titles of all bug reports which this bug is merged
          with.

   severity bugnumber severity
          Set the severity level for bug report #bugnumber to severity. No
          notification is sent to the user who reported the bug.

          Severities are critical, grave, serious, important, normal,
          minor, wishlist.

          For their meanings please consult the general developers'
          documentation for the bug system.

   affects bugnumber [ + | - | = ] package [ package ... ]
          Indicates that a bug affects another package. In the case where
          bugnumber causes breakage in package even though the bug is
          actually present in the package to which it is assigned, this
          causes the bug to be listed by default in the bug list of
          package. This should generally be used where the bug is severe
          enough to cause multiple reports from users to be assigned to
          the wrong package. = sets the affects to the list of packages
          given, and is the default action if no packages are given; -
          removes the given packages from the affects list; + adds the
          given packages to the affects list, and is the default if
          packages are given.

   summary bugnumber [message number | summary text]
          Selects a message to use as a summary of a bug. The first
          non-pseudoheader/non-control paragraph of that message is parsed
          and set as the summary of the bug which is displayed on the top
          of the bug report page. This is useful in cases where the
          original report doesn't correctly describe the problem or the
          bug has many messages which make it difficult to identify the
          actual problem.

          If message number is not given, clears the summary. message
          number is the message number as listed in the bugreport cgi
          script output; if a message number of 0 is given, the current
          message is used (that is, the message which was sent to
          control@bugs.debian.org which contains the summary control
          command).

          If message number is not numerical and not the empty string, it
          is assumed to be the text to set the summary to.

   outlook bugnumber [message number | outlook text]
          Selects a message to use as the outlook for fixing a bug (or the
          current status of fixing a bug). The first
          non-pseudoheader/non-control paragraph of that message is parsed
          and set as the outlook of the bug which is displayed on the top
          of the bug report page. This is useful to coordinate with others
          who are working on fixing this bug (for example, in an bug
          squashing party).

          If message number is not given, clears the outlook. message
          number is the message number as listed in the bugreport cgi
          script output; if a message number of 0 is given, the current
          message is used (that is, the message which was sent to
          control@bugs.debian.org which contains the outlook control
          command).

          If message number is not numerical and not the empty string, it
          is assumed to be the text to set the outlook to.

   clone bugnumber NewID [ new IDs ... ]
          The clone control command allows you to duplicate a bug report.
          It is useful in the case where a single report actually
          indicates that multiple distinct bugs have occurred. "New IDs"
          are negative numbers, separated by spaces, which may be used in
          subsequent control commands to refer to the newly duplicated
          bugs. A new report is generated for each new ID.

          Example usage:

          clone 12345 -1 -2
          reassign -1 foo
          retitle -1 foo: foo sucks
          reassign -2 bar
          retitle -2 bar: bar sucks when used with foo
          severity -2 wishlist
          clone 123456 -3
          reassign -3 foo
          retitle -3 foo: foo sucks
          merge -1 -3

   merge bugnumber bugnumber ...
          Merges two or more bug reports. When reports are merged opening,
          closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any
          of the bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on
          all of the merged reports.

          Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same
          state: either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to
          upstream author address or all not marked as forwarded, all
          assigned to the same package or package(s) (an exact string
          comparison is done on the package to which the bug is assigned),
          and all of the same severity. If they don't start out in the
          same state you should use reassign, reopen and so forth to make
          sure that they are before using merge. Titles are not required
          to match, and will not be affected by the merge. Tags are not
          required to match, either, they will be joined.

          If any of the bugs listed in a merge command is already merged
          with another bug then all the reports merged with any of the
          ones listed will all be merged together. Merger is like
          equality: it is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.

          Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs;
          on the WWW pages this is includes links to the other bugs.

          Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all
          of the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

   forcemerge bugnumber bugnumber ...
          Forcibly merges two or more bug reports. The settings of the
          first bug listed which must be equal in a normal merge are
          assigned to the bugs listed next. To avoid typos erroneously
          merging bugs, bugs must be in the same package. See the text
          above for a description of what merging means.

          Note that this makes it possible to close bugs by merging; you
          are responsible for notifying submitters with an appropriate
          close message if you do this.

   unmerge bugnumber
          Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it
          may have been merged. If the report listed is merged with
          several others then they are all left merged with each other;
          only their associations with the bug explicitly named are
          removed.

          If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into
          two separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each
          report in one of the new groups separately and then merge them
          into the required new group.

          You can only unmerge one report with each unmerge command; if
          you want to disconnect more than one bug simply include several
          unmerge commands in your message.

   tags bugnumber [ + | - | = ] tag [ tag ... ] [ + | - | = tag ... ] ]
          Sets tags for the bug report #bugnumber. No notification is sent
          to the user who reported the bug. Setting the action to + means
          to add each tag following, - means to remove each tag following,
          and = means to set the following tags to the list provided.
          Intervening +, -, or = change the action for the tags following.
          The default action is adding.

          Example usage:

          # same as 'tags 123456 + patch'
          tags 123456 patch

          # same as 'tags 123456 + help security'
          tags 123456 help security

          # add 'fixed' and 'pending' tags
          tags 123456 + fixed pending

          # remove 'unreproducible' tag
          tags 123456 - unreproducible

          # set tags to exactly 'moreinfo' and 'unreproducible'
          tags 123456 = moreinfo unreproducible

          # remove the moreinfo tag and add a patch tag
          tags 123456 - moreinfo + patch

          Available tags currently include patch, wontfix, moreinfo,
          unreproducible, help, security, upstream, pending, confirmed,
          ipv6, lfs, d-i, l10n, newcomer, a11y, ftbfs, fixed-upstream,
          fixed, fixed-in-experimental, potato, woody, sarge, etch, lenny,
          squeeze, wheezy, jessie, stretch, buster, bullseye, bookworm,
          trixie, sid, experimental, sarge-ignore, etch-ignore,
          lenny-ignore, squeeze-ignore, wheezy-ignore, jessie-ignore,
          stretch-ignore, buster-ignore, bullseye-ignore, bookworm-ignore,
          trixie-ignore .

          For their meanings please consult the general developers'
          documentation for the bug system.

   block bugnumber by bug ...
          Note that the fix for the first bug is blocked by the other
          listed bugs.

   unblock bugnumber by bug ...
          Note that the fix for the first bug is no longer blocked by the
          other listed bugs.

   close bugnumber [ fixed-version ] (deprecated)
          Close bug report #bugnumber.

          A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
          contrast to mailing bugnumber-done@bugs.debian.org) the text of
          the mail which caused the bug to be closed is not included in
          that notification. The maintainer who closes a report needs to
          ensure, probably by sending a separate message, that the user
          who reported the bug knows why it is being closed. The use of
          this command is therefore deprecated. See the developer's
          information about how to close a bug properly.

          If you supply a fixed-version, the bug tracking system will note
          that the bug was fixed in that version of the package.

   package [ packagename ... ]
          Limits the following commands so that they will only apply to
          bugs filed against the listed packages. You can list one or more
          packages. If you don't list any packages, the following commands
          will apply to all bugs. You're encouraged to use this as a
          safety feature in case you accidentally use the wrong bug
          numbers.

          Example usage:

          package foo
          reassign 123456 bar 1.0-1

          package bar
          retitle 123456 bar: bar sucks
          severity 123456 normal

          package
          severity 234567 wishlist

   owner bugnumber address | !
          Sets address to be the "owner" of #bugnumber. The owner of a bug
          claims responsibility for fixing it. This is useful to share out
          work in cases where a package has a team of maintainers.

          If you wish to become the owner of the bug yourself, you can use
          the ! shorthand or specify your own email address.

   noowner bugnumber
          Forgets any idea that the bug has an owner other than the usual
          maintainer. If the bug had no owner recorded then this will do
          nothing.

   archive bugnumber
          Archives a bug that had been archived at some point in the past
          but is currently not archived if the bug fulfills the
          requirements for archival, ignoring time.

   unarchive bugnumber
          Unarchives a bug that was previously archived. Unarchival should
          generally be coupled with reopen and found/fixed as appropriate.
          Bugs that have been unarchived can be archived using archive
          assuming the non-time based archival requirements are met. You
          should not be using unarchive to make trivial changes to
          archived bugs, such as changing the submitter; its primary
          purpose is to allow for the reopening of bugs which have been
          archived without the intervention of BTS administrators.

   #...
          One-line comment. The # must be at the start of the line. The
          text of comments will be included in the acknowledgement sent to
          the sender and to affected maintainers, so you can use this to
          document the reasons for your commands.

   quit
   stop
   thank
   thanks
   thankyou
   thank you
   --
          On a line by itself, in any case, possibly followed by
          whitespace, tells the control server to stop processing the
          message; the remainder of the message can include explanations,
          signatures or anything else, none of it will be detected by the
          control server.

   Debian bug tracking system / Debian BTS - reporting bugs

How to report a bug in Debian using reportbug

   We strongly recommend that you report bugs in Debian using the
   reportbug program.

   reportbug is installed by default on most systems. If it is not
   available, it can be installed using the package management tool
   available on your system.

   reportbug can be started from the system section of the menu or by
   running reportbug via the command-line.

   It will guide you through the bug reporting process step by step.

   If you have questions that the interactive prompts of reportbug do not
   resolve, you can refer to the rest of the documentation below or ask
   the Debian user mailing list.

How to report a bug in Debian using email (and advanced usage of reportbug)

Important things to note before sending your bug report

What package does your bug report belong to?

   You need to know what package your bug report should be filed against.
   See this example for information on how to find this information. (You
   will use this information to see if your bug report has been filed
   already.)

   If you are unable to determine which package your bug report should be
   filed against, please send e-mail to the Debian user mailing list
   asking for advice.

   If your problem doesn't relate just to one package but some general
   Debian service, there are several pseudo-packages or even mailing lists
   that you can use to relay your message to us instead.

Has your bug report been filed already?

   You should check to see if your bug report has already been filed
   before submitting it. You can see which bugs have been filed in a
   specific package using the package option of the bug search form. If
   there is an existing bug report #<number>, you should submit your
   comments by sending e-mail to <number>@bugs.debian.org instead of
   reporting a new bug.

Send multiple reports for multiple bugs

   Please don't report multiple unrelated bugs — especially ones in
   different packages — in a single bug report.

Don't file bugs upstream

   If you file a bug in Debian, don't send a copy to the upstream software
   maintainers yourself, as it is possible that the bug exists only in
   Debian. If necessary, the maintainer of the package will forward the
   bug upstream.

Sending the bug report via e-mail

   You can report bugs in Debian by sending an e-mail to
   submit@bugs.debian.org with a special format described below. reportbug
   (see above) will properly format the e-mails for you; please use it!

Headers

   Like any e-mail you should include a clear, descriptive Subject line in
   your main mail header. The subject you give will be used as the initial
   bug title in the tracking system, so please try to make it informative!

   If you'd like to send a copy of your bug report to additional
   recipients (such as mailing lists), you shouldn't use the usual e-mail
   headers, but a different method, described below.

Pseudo-headers

   The first part of the bug report are the pseudo-headers which contain
   information about what package and version your bug report applies to.
   The first line of the message body has to include a pseudo-header. It
   should say:
Package: <packagename>

   Replace <packagename> with the name of the package which has the bug.

   The second line of the message should say:
Version: <packageversion>

   Replace <packageversion> with the version of the package. Please don't
   include any text here other than the version itself, as the bug
   tracking system relies on this field to work out which releases are
   affected by the bug.

   You need to supply a correct Package line in the pseudo-header in order
   for the bug tracking system to deliver the message to the package's
   maintainer. See this example for information on how to find this
   information.

   For other valid pseudo-headers, see Additional pseudo-headers

The body of the report

   Please include in your report:
     * The exact and complete text of any error messages printed or
       logged. This is very important!
     * Exactly what you typed or did to demonstrate the problem.
     * A description of the incorrect behavior: exactly what behavior you
       were expecting, and what you observed. A transcript of an example
       session is a good way of showing this.
     * A suggested fix, or even a patch, if you have one.
     * Details of the configuration of the program with the problem.
       Include the complete text of its configuration files.
     * The versions of any packages on which the buggy package depends.
     * What kernel version you're using (type uname -a), your shared C
       library (type ls -l /lib/*/libc.so.6 or apt show libc6 | grep
       ^Version), and any other details about your Debian system, if it
       seems appropriate. For example, if you had a problem with a Perl
       script, you would want to provide the version of the `perl' binary
       (type perl -v or dpkg -s perl | grep ^Version:).
     * Appropriate details of the hardware in your system. If you're
       reporting a problem with a device driver please list all the
       hardware in your system, as problems are often caused by IRQ and
       I/O address conflicts.
     * If you have reportbug installed the output of reportbug --template
       -T none -s none -S normal -b --list-cc none -q <package> will also
       be useful, as it contains the output of maintainer specific scripts
       and version information.

   Include any detail that seems relevant — you are in very little danger
   of making your report too long by including too much information. If
   they are small, please include in your report any files you were using
   to reproduce the problem. (If they are large, consider making them
   available on a publicly available website if possible.)

   For more advice on how to help the developers solve your problem,
   please read How to Report Bugs Effectively.

An Example Bug Report

   A bug report with header and pseudo-header looks something like this:
  To: submit@bugs.debian.org
  From: diligent@testing.linux.org
  Subject: Hello says `goodbye'

  Package: hello
  Version: 1.3-16

  When I invoke `hello' without arguments from an ordinary shell
  prompt it prints `goodbye', rather than the expected `hello, world'.
  Here is a transcript:

  $ hello
  goodbye
  $ /usr/bin/hello
  goodbye
  $

  I suggest that the output string, in hello.c, be corrected.

  I am using Debian GNU/Linux 2.2, kernel 2.2.17-pre-patch-13

Sending copies of bug reports to other addresses

   Sometimes it is necessary to send a copy of a bug report to somewhere
   else besides debian-bugs-dist and the package maintainer, which is
   where they are normally sent.

   You could do this by CC'ing your bug report to the other address(es),
   but then the other copies would not have the bug report number put in
   the Reply-To field and the Subject line. When the recipients reply they
   will probably preserve the submit@bugs.debian.org entry in the header
   and have their message filed as a new bug report. This leads to many
   duplicated reports.

   The right way to do this is to use the X-Debbugs-CC header. Add a line
   like this to your message's mail header:
 X-Debbugs-CC: other-list@cosmic.edu

   This will cause the bug tracking system to send a copy of your report
   to the address(es) in the X-Debbugs-CC line as well as to
   debian-bugs-dist.

   If you want to send copies to more than one address, add them
   comma-separated in only one X-Debbugs-CC line.

   Avoid sending such copies to the addresses of other bug reports, as
   they will be caught by the checks that prevent mail loops. There is
   relatively little point in using X-Debbugs-CC for this anyway, as the
   bug number added by that mechanism will just be replaced by a new one;
   use an ordinary CC header instead.

   This feature can often be combined usefully with mailing quiet — see
   below.

Additional Pseudoheaders

Severity levels

   If a report is of a particularly serious bug, or is merely a feature
   request, you can set the severity level of the bug as you report it.
   This is not required however, and the package maintainer will assign an
   appropriate severity level to your report even if you do not (or pick
   the wrong severity).

   To assign a severity level, put a line like this one in the
   pseudo-header:
Severity: <severity>

   Replace <severity> with one of the available severity levels, as
   described in the advanced documentation.

Assigning tags

   You can set tags on a bug as you are reporting it. For example, if you
   are including a patch with your bug report, you may wish to set the
   patch tag. This is not required, however, and the developers will set
   tags on your report as and when it is appropriate.

   To set tags, put a line like this one in the pseudo-header:
Tags: <tags>

   Replace <tags> with one or more of the available tags, as described in
   the advanced documentation. Separate multiple tags with commas, spaces,
   or both.
User: <username>
Usertags: <usertags>

   Replace <usertags> with one or more usertags. Separate multiple tags
   with commas, spaces, or both. If you specify a <username>, that user's
   tags will be set. Otherwise, the e-mail address of the sender will be
   used as the username.

   You can set usertags for multiple users at bug submission time by
   including multiple User pseudo-headers; each Usertags pseudo-header
   sets the usertags for the preceding User pseudo-header. This is
   especially useful for setting usertags for a team with multiple users,
   setting usertags for multiple teams, or setting the architecture
   usertags for bugs affecting multiple architectures.
User: <first-username>
Usertags: <first-username usertags>
User: <second-username>
Usertags: <second-username usertags>

Setting Forwarded

Forwarded: foo@example.com

   will mark the newly submitted bug as forwarded to foo@example.com. See
   Recording that you have passed on a bug report in the developers'
   documentation for details.

Claiming ownership

Owner: foo@example.com

   will indicate that foo@example.com is now responsible for fixing this
   bug. See Changing bug ownership in the developers' documentation for
   details.

Source Package

Source: foopackage

   the equivalent of Package: for bugs present in the source package of
   foopackage; for most bugs in most packages you don't want to use this
   option.

Control Commands

Control: control commands

   Allows for any of the commands which must be sent to
   control@bugs.debian.org to work when sent to submit@bugs.debian.org or
   nnn@bugs.debian.org. -1 initially refers to the current bug (that is,
   the bug created by a mail to submit@ or the bug messaged with nnn@).
   Please see the server control documentation for more information on the
   control commands which are valid.

   For example, the following pseudoheader in a message sent to
   12345@bugs.debian.org:
Control: retitle -1 this is the title
Control: severity -1 normal
Control: summary -1 0
Control: forwarded -1 https://bugs.debian.org/nnn

   would cause 12345 to be retitled, its severity changed, summary set,
   and marked as forwarded.

X-Debbugs- headers

   Finally, if your MUA doesn't allow you to edit the headers, you can set
   the various X-Debbugs- headers in the pseudo-headers.

Additional information

Different submission addresses (minor or mass bug reports)

   If a bug report is minor, for example, a documentation typo or a
   trivial build problem, please adjust the severity appropriately and
   send it to maintonly@bugs.debian.org instead of submit@bugs.debian.org.
   maintonly will forward the report to the package maintainer only, it
   won't forward it to the BTS mailing lists.

   If you're submitting many reports at once, you should definitely use
   maintonly@bugs.debian.org so that you don't cause too much redundant
   traffic on the BTS mailing lists. Before submitting many similar bugs
   you may also want to post a summary on debian-bugs-dist.

   If wish to report a bug to the bug tracking system that's already been
   sent to the maintainer, you can use quiet@bugs.debian.org. Bugs sent to
   quiet@bugs.debian.org will not be forwarded anywhere, only filed.

   When you use different submission addresses, the bug tracking system
   will set the Reply-To of any forwarded message so that the replies will
   by default be processed in the same way as the original report. That
   means that, for example, replies to maintonly will go to
   nnn-maintonly@bugs.debian.org instead of nnn@bugs.debian.org, unless of
   course one overrides this manually.

Acknowledgements

   Normally, the bug tracking system will return an acknowledgement to you
   by e-mail when you report a new bug or submit additional information to
   an existing bug. If you want to suppress this acknowledgement, include
   an X-Debbugs-No-Ack header or pseudoheader in your e-mail (the contents
   of this header do not matter). If you report a new bug with this
   header, you will need to check the web interface yourself to find the
   bug number.

   Note that this header will not suppress acknowledgements from the
   control@bugs.debian.org mailserver, since those acknowledgements may
   contain error messages which should be read and acted upon.

Spamfighting and missing mail

   The bug tracking system implements a rather extensive set of rules
   designed to make sure that spam does not make it through the BTS. While
   we try to minimize the number of false positives, they do occur. If you
   suspect your mail has triggered a false positive, feel free to contact
   owner@bugs.debian.org for assistance. Another common cause of mail not
   making it through to the BTS is utilizing addresses which match
   procmail's FROM_DAEMON, which includes mail from addresses like
   mail@foobar.com. If you suspect your mail matches FROM_DAEMON, see
   procmailrc(5) to verify, and then resend the mail using an address
   which does not match FROM_DAEMON.

Bug reports against unknown packages

   If the bug tracking system doesn't know who the maintainer of the
   relevant package is it will forward the report to debian-bugs-dist even
   if maintonly was used.

   When sending to maintonly@bugs.debian.org or
   nnn-maintonly@bugs.debian.org you should make sure that the bug report
   is assigned to the right package, by putting a correct Package at the
   top of an original submission of a report, or by using the
   control@bugs.debian.org service to (re)assign the report appropriately.

Using dpkg to find the package and version for the report

   When using reportbug to report a bug in a command, say grep, the
   following will automatically select the right package and let you write
   the report right away: reportbug --file $(which grep)

   You can also find out which package installed it by using dpkg
   --search. You can find out which version of a package you have
   installed by using dpkg --list or dpkg --status.

   For example:
$ which apt-get
/usr/bin/apt-get
$ type apt-get
apt-get is /usr/bin/apt-get
$ dpkg --search /usr/bin/apt-get
apt: /usr/bin/apt-get
$ dpkg --list apt
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold

 and several other unique features, see the Users Guide in
 /usr/doc/apt/guide.text.gz

Other useful commands and packages

   The querybts tool, available from the same package as reportbug,
   provides a convenient text-based interface to the bug tracking system.

   Emacs users can also use the debian-bug command provided by the
   debian-el package. When called with M-x debian-bug, it will ask for all
   necessary information in a similar way to reportbug.

   Version 1.7 ratified on August 14th, 2016. Supersedes Version 1.6
   ratified on December 13th, 2015, Version 1.5 ratified on January 9th,
   2015, Version 1.4 ratified on October 7th, 2007, Version 1.3 ratified
   on September 24th, 2006, Version 1.2 ratified on October 29th, 2003 and
   Version 1.1 ratified on June 21st, 2003, which itself supersedes
   Version 1.0 ratified on December 2nd, 1998.

1. Introduction

   The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made
   common cause to create a free operating system.

   This document describes the organisational structure for formal
   decision-making in the Project. It does not describe the goals of the
   Project or how it achieves them, or contain any policies except those
   directly related to the decision-making process.

2. Decision-making bodies and individuals

   Each decision in the Project is made by one or more of the following:
    1. The Developers, by way of General Resolution or an election;
    2. The Project Leader;
    3. The Technical Committee and/or its Chair;
    4. The individual Developer working on a particular task;
    5. Delegates appointed by the Project Leader for specific tasks;
    6. The Project Secretary.

   Most of the remainder of this document will outline the powers of these
   bodies, their composition and appointment, and the procedure for their
   decision-making. The powers of a person or body may be subject to
   review and/or limitation by others; in this case the reviewing body or
   person's entry will state this. In the list above, a person or body is
   usually listed before any people or bodies whose decisions they can
   overrule or who they (help) appoint - but not everyone listed earlier
   can overrule everyone listed later.

  2.1. General rules

    1. Nothing in this constitution imposes an obligation on anyone to do
       work for the Project. A person who does not want to do a task which
       has been delegated or assigned to them does not need to do it.
       However, they must not actively work against these rules and
       decisions properly made under them.
    2. A person may hold several posts, except that the Project Leader,
       Project Secretary and the Chair of the Technical Committee must be
       distinct, and that the Leader cannot appoint themselves as their
       own Delegate.
    3. A person may leave the Project or resign from a particular post
       they hold, at any time, by stating so publicly.

3. Individual Developers

  3.1. Powers

   An individual Developer may
    1. make any technical or nontechnical decision with regard to their
       own work;
    2. propose or sponsor draft General Resolutions;
    3. propose themselves as a Project Leader candidate in elections;
    4. vote on General Resolutions and in Leadership elections.

  3.2. Composition and appointment

    1. Developers are volunteers who agree to further the aims of the
       Project insofar as they participate in it, and who maintain
       package(s) for the Project or do other work which the Project
       Leader's Delegate(s) consider worthwhile.
    2. The Project Leader's Delegate(s) may choose not to admit new
       Developers, or expel existing Developers. If the Developers feel
       that the Delegates are abusing their authority they can of course
       override the decision by way of General Resolution - see 4.1(3),
       4.2.

  3.3. Procedure

   Developers may make these decisions as they see fit.

4. The Developers by way of General Resolution or election

  4.1. Powers

   Together, the Developers may:
    1. Appoint or recall the Project Leader.
    2. Amend this constitution, provided they agree with a 3:1 majority.
    3. Make or override any decision authorised by the powers of the
       Project Leader or a Delegate.
    4. Make or override any decision authorised by the powers of the
       Technical Committee, provided they agree with a 2:1 majority.
    5. Issue, supersede and withdraw nontechnical policy documents and
       statements.
       These include documents describing the goals of the project, its
       relationship with other free software entities, and nontechnical
       policies such as the free software licence terms that Debian
       software must meet.
       They may also include position statements about issues of the day.
         1. A Foundation Document is a document or statement regarded as
            critical to the Project's mission and purposes.
         2. The Foundation Documents are the works entitled "Debian Social
            Contract" and "Debian Free Software Guidelines".
         3. A Foundation Document requires a 3:1 majority for its
            supersession. New Foundation Documents are issued and existing
            ones withdrawn by amending the list of Foundation Documents in
            this constitution.
    6. Make decisions about property held in trust for purposes related to
       Debian. (See 9.).
    7. In case of a disagreement between the project leader and the
       incumbent secretary, appoint a new secretary.

  4.2. Procedure

    1. The Developers follow the Standard Resolution Procedure, below. A
       resolution or amendment is introduced if proposed by any Developer
       and sponsored by at least K other Developers, or if proposed by the
       Project Leader or the Technical Committee.
    2. Delaying a decision by the Project Leader or their Delegate:
         1. If the Project Leader or their Delegate, or the Technical
            Committee, has made a decision, then Developers can override
            them by passing a resolution to do so; see 4.1(3).
         2. If such a resolution is sponsored by at least 2K Developers,
            or if it is proposed by the Technical Committee, the
            resolution puts the decision immediately on hold (provided
            that resolution itself says so).
         3. If the original decision was to change a discussion period or
            a voting period, or the resolution is to override the
            Technical Committee, then only K Developers need to sponsor
            the resolution to be able to put the decision immediately on
            hold.
         4. If the decision is put on hold, an immediate vote is held to
            determine whether the decision will stand until the full vote
            on the decision is made or whether the implementation of the
            original decision will be delayed until then. There is no
            quorum for this immediate procedural vote.
         5. If the Project Leader (or the Delegate) withdraws the original
            decision, the vote becomes moot, and is no longer conducted.
    3. Votes are taken by the Project Secretary. Votes, tallies, and
       results are not revealed during the voting period; after the vote
       the Project Secretary lists all the votes cast. The voting period
       is 2 weeks, but may be varied by up to 1 week by the Project
       Leader.
    4. The minimum discussion period is 2 weeks, but may be varied by up
       to 1 week by the Project Leader. The Project Leader has a casting
       vote. There is a quorum of 3Q.
    5. Proposals, sponsors, amendments, calls for votes and other formal
       actions are made by announcement on a publicly-readable electronic
       mailing list designated by the Project Leader's Delegate(s); any
       Developer may post there.
    6. Votes are cast by email in a manner suitable to the Secretary. The
       Secretary determines for each poll whether voters can change their
       votes.
    7. Q is half of the square root of the number of current Developers. K
       is Q or 5, whichever is the smaller. Q and K need not be integers
       and are not rounded.

5. Project Leader

  5.1. Powers

   The Project Leader may:
    1. Appoint Delegates or delegate decisions to the Technical Committee.
       The Leader may define an area of ongoing responsibility or a
       specific decision and hand it over to another Developer or to the
       Technical Committee.
       Once a particular decision has been delegated and made the Project
       Leader may not withdraw that delegation; however, they may withdraw
       an ongoing delegation of particular area of responsibility.
    2. Lend authority to other Developers.
       The Project Leader may make statements of support for points of
       view or for other members of the project, when asked or otherwise;
       these statements have force if and only if the Leader would be
       empowered to make the decision in question.
    3. Make any decision which requires urgent action.
       This does not apply to decisions which have only become gradually
       urgent through lack of relevant action, unless there is a fixed
       deadline.
    4. Make any decision for whom noone else has responsibility.
    5. Propose draft General Resolutions and amendments.
    6. Together with the Technical Committee, appoint new members to the
       Committee. (See 6.2.)
    7. Use a casting vote when Developers vote.
       The Project Leader also has a normal vote in such ballots.
    8. Vary the discussion period for Developers' votes (as above).
    9. Lead discussions amongst Developers.
       The Project Leader should attempt to participate in discussions
       amongst the Developers in a helpful way which seeks to bring the
       discussion to bear on the key issues at hand. The Project Leader
       should not use the Leadership position to promote their own
       personal views.
   10. In consultation with the developers, make decisions affecting
       property held in trust for purposes related to Debian. (See 9.).
       Such decisions are communicated to the members by the Project
       Leader or their Delegate(s). Major expenditures should be proposed
       and debated on the mailing list before funds are disbursed.
   11. Add or remove organizations from the list of trusted organizations
       (see 9.3) that are authorized to accept and hold assets for
       Debian. The evaluation and discussion leading up to such a decision
       occurs on an electronic mailing list designated by the Project
       Leader or their Delegate(s), on which any developer may post. There
       is a minimum discussion period of two weeks before an organization
       may be added to the list of trusted organizations.

  5.2. Appointment

    1. The Project Leader is elected by the Developers.
    2. The election begins six weeks before the leadership post becomes
       vacant, or (if it is too late already) immediately.
    3. For the first week any Developer may nominate themselves as a
       candidate Project Leader, and summarize their plans for their term.
    4. For three weeks after that no more candidates may be nominated;
       candidates should use this time for campaigning and discussion. If
       there are no candidates at the end of the nomination period then
       the nomination period is extended for an additional week,
       repeatedly if necessary.
    5. The next two weeks are the polling period during which Developers
       may cast their votes. Votes in leadership elections are kept
       secret, even after the election is finished.
    6. The options on the ballot will be those candidates who have
       nominated themselves and have not yet withdrawn, plus None Of The
       Above. If None Of The Above wins the election then the election
       procedure is repeated, many times if necessary.
    7. The decision will be made using the method specified in section
       A.6 of the Standard Resolution Procedure. The quorum is the same
       as for a General Resolution (4.2) and the default option is "None
       Of The Above".
    8. The Project Leader serves for one year from their election.

  5.3. Procedure

   The Project Leader should attempt to make decisions which are
   consistent with the consensus of the opinions of the Developers.

   Where practical the Project Leader should informally solicit the views
   of the Developers.

   The Project Leader should avoid overemphasizing their own point of view
   when making decisions in their capacity as Leader.

6. Technical committee

  6.1. Powers

   The Technical Committee may:
    1. Decide on any matter of technical policy.
       This includes the contents of the technical policy manuals,
       developers' reference materials, example packages and the behaviour
       of non-experimental package building tools. (In each case the usual
       maintainer of the relevant software or documentation makes
       decisions initially, however; see 6.3(5).)
    2. Decide any technical matter where Developers' jurisdictions
       overlap.
       In cases where Developers need to implement compatible technical
       policies or stances (for example, if they disagree about the
       priorities of conflicting packages, or about ownership of a command
       name, or about which package is responsible for a bug that both
       maintainers agree is a bug, or about who should be the maintainer
       for a package) the technical committee may decide the matter.
    3. Make a decision when asked to do so.
       Any person or body may delegate a decision of their own to the
       Technical Committee, or seek advice from it.
    4. Overrule a Developer (requires a 3:1 majority).
       The Technical Committee may ask a Developer to take a particular
       technical course of action even if the Developer does not wish to;
       this requires a 3:1 majority. For example, the Committee may
       determine that a complaint made by the submitter of a bug is
       justified and that the submitter's proposed solution should be
       implemented.
    5. Offer advice.
       The Technical Committee may make formal announcements about its
       views on any matter. Individual members may of course make informal
       statements about their views and about the likely views of the
       committee.
    6. Together with the Project Leader, appoint new members to itself or
       remove existing members. (See 6.2.)
    7. Appoint the Chair of the Technical Committee.
       The Chair is elected by the Committee from its members. All members
       of the committee are automatically nominated; the committee votes
       starting one week before the post will become vacant (or
       immediately, if it is already too late). The members may vote by
       public acclamation for any fellow committee member, including
       themselves; there is no default option. The vote finishes when all
       the members have voted, or when the voting period has ended. The
       result is determined using the method specified in section A.6 of
       the Standard Resolution Procedure.
    8. The Chair can stand in for the Leader, together with the Secretary
       As detailed in 7.1(2), the Chair of the Technical Committee and
       the Project Secretary may together stand in for the Leader if there
       is no Leader.

  6.2. Composition

    1. The Technical Committee consists of up to 8 Developers, and should
       usually have at least 4 members.
    2. When there are fewer than 8 members the Technical Committee may
       recommend new member(s) to the Project Leader, who may choose
       (individually) to appoint them or not.
    3. When there are 5 members or fewer the Technical Committee may
       appoint new member(s) until the number of members reaches 6.
    4. When there have been 5 members or fewer for at least one week the
       Project Leader may appoint new member(s) until the number of
       members reaches 6, at intervals of at least one week per
       appointment.
    5. A Developer is not eligible to be (re)appointed to the Technical
       Committee if they have been a member within the previous 12 months.
    6. If the Technical Committee and the Project Leader agree they may
       remove or replace an existing member of the Technical Committee.
    7. Term limit:
         1. On January 1st of each year the term of any Committee member
            who has served more than 42 months (3.5 years) and who is one
            of the two most senior members is set to expire on December
            31st of that year.
         2. A member of the Technical Committee is said to be more senior
            than another if they were appointed earlier, or were appointed
            at the same time and have been a member of the Debian Project
            longer. In the event that a member has been appointed more
            than once, only the most recent appointment is relevant.

  6.3. Procedure

    1. The Technical Committee uses the Standard Resolution Procedure.
       A draft resolution or amendment may be proposed by any member of
       the Technical Committee. There is no minimum discussion period; the
       voting period lasts for up to one week, or until the outcome is no
       longer in doubt. Members may change their votes. There is a quorum
       of two.
    2. Details regarding voting
       The Chair has a casting vote. When the Technical Committee votes
       whether to override a Developer who also happens to be a member of
       the Committee, that member may not vote (unless they are the Chair,
       in which case they may use only their casting vote).
    3. Public discussion and decision-making.
       Discussion, draft resolutions and amendments, and votes by members
       of the committee, are made public on the Technical Committee public
       discussion list. There is no separate secretary for the Committee.
    4. Confidentiality of appointments.
       The Technical Committee may hold confidential discussions via
       private email or a private mailing list or other means to discuss
       appointments to the Committee. However, votes on appointments must
       be public.
    5. No detailed design work.
       The Technical Committee does not engage in design of new proposals
       and policies. Such design work should be carried out by individuals
       privately or together and discussed in ordinary technical policy
       and design forums.
       The Technical Committee restricts itself to choosing from or
       adopting compromises between solutions and decisions which have
       been proposed and reasonably thoroughly discussed elsewhere.
       Individual members of the technical committee may of course
       participate on their own behalf in any aspect of design and policy
       work.
    6. Technical Committee makes decisions only as last resort.
       The Technical Committee does not make a technical decision until
       efforts to resolve it via consensus have been tried and failed,
       unless it has been asked to make a decision by the person or body
       who would normally be responsible for it.

7. The Project Secretary

  7.1. Powers

   The Secretary:
    1. Takes votes amongst the Developers, and determines the number and
       identity of Developers, whenever this is required by the
       constitution.
    2. Can stand in for the Leader, together with the Chair of the
       Technical Committee.
       If there is no Project Leader then the Chair of the Technical
       Committee and the Project Secretary may by joint agreement make
       decisions if they consider it imperative to do so.
    3. Adjudicates any disputes about interpretation of the constitution.
    4. May delegate part or all of their authority to someone else, or
       withdraw such a delegation at any time.

  7.2. Appointment

   The Project Secretary is appointed by the Project Leader and the
   current Project Secretary.

   If the Project Leader and the current Project Secretary cannot agree on
   a new appointment, they must ask the Developers by way of General
   Resolution to appoint a Secretary.

   If there is no Project Secretary or the current Secretary is
   unavailable and has not delegated authority for a decision then the
   decision may be made or delegated by the Chair of the Technical
   Committee, as Acting Secretary.

   The Project Secretary's term of office is 1 year, at which point they
   or another Secretary must be (re)appointed.

  7.3. Procedure

   The Project Secretary should make decisions which are fair and
   reasonable, and preferably consistent with the consensus of the
   Developers.

   When acting together to stand in for an absent Project Leader the Chair
   of the Technical Committee and the Project Secretary should make
   decisions only when absolutely necessary and only when consistent with
   the consensus of the Developers.

8. The Project Leader's Delegates

  8.1. Powers

   The Project Leader's Delegates:
    1. have powers delegated to them by the Project Leader;
    2. may make certain decisions which the Leader may not make directly,
       including approving or expelling Developers or designating people
       as Developers who do not maintain packages. This is to avoid
       concentration of power, particularly over membership as a
       Developer, in the hands of the Project Leader.

  8.2. Appointment

   The Delegates are appointed by the Project Leader and may be replaced
   by the Leader at the Leader's discretion. The Project Leader may not
   make the position as a Delegate conditional on particular decisions by
   the Delegate, nor may they override a decision made by a Delegate once
   made.

  8.3. Procedure

   Delegates may make decisions as they see fit, but should attempt to
   implement good technical decisions and/or follow consensus opinion.

9. Assets held in trust for Debian

   In most jurisdictions around the world, the Debian project is not in a
   position to directly hold funds or other property. Therefore, property
   has to be owned by any of a number of organisations as detailed in
   9.2.

   Traditionally, SPI was the sole organisation authorized to hold
   property and monies for the Debian Project. SPI was created in the U.S.
   to hold money in trust there.

   SPI and Debian are separate organisations who share some goals. Debian
   is grateful for the legal support framework offered by SPI.

  9.1. Relationship with Associated Organizations

    1. Debian Developers do not become agents or employees of
       organisations holding assets in trust for Debian, or of each other,
       or of persons in authority in the Debian Project, solely by the
       virtue of being Debian Developers. A person acting as a Developer
       does so as an individual, on their own behalf. Such organisations
       may, of their own accord, establish relationships with individuals
       who are also Debian developers.

  9.2. Authority

    1. An organisation holding assets for Debian has no authority
       regarding Debian's technical or nontechnical decisions, except that
       no decision by Debian with respect to any property held by the
       organisation shall require it to act outside its legal authority.
    2. Debian claims no authority over an organisation that holds assets
       for Debian other than that over the use of property held in trust
       for Debian.

  9.3. Trusted organisations

   Any donations for the Debian Project must be made to any one of a set
   of organisations designated by the Project leader (or a delegate) to be
   authorized to handle assets to be used for the Debian Project.

   Organisations holding assets in trust for Debian should undertake
   reasonable obligations for the handling of such assets.

   Debian maintains a public List of Trusted Organisations that accept
   donations and hold assets in trust for Debian (including both tangible
   property and intellectual property) that includes the commitments those
   organisations have made as to how those assets will be handled.

A. Standard Resolution Procedure

   These rules apply to communal decision-making by committees and
   plebiscites, where stated above.

  A.0. Proposal

   The formal procedure begins when a draft resolution is proposed and
   sponsored, as required.

  A.1. Discussion and Amendment

    1. Following the proposal, the resolution may be discussed. Amendments
       may be made formal by being proposed and sponsored according to the
       requirements for a new resolution, or directly by the proposer of
       the original resolution.
    2. A formal amendment may be accepted by the resolution's proposer, in
       which case the formal resolution draft is immediately changed to
       match.
    3. If a formal amendment is not accepted, or one of the sponsors of
       the resolution does not agree with the acceptance by the proposer
       of a formal amendment, the amendment remains as an amendment and
       will be voted on.
    4. If an amendment accepted by the original proposer is not to the
       liking of others, they may propose another amendment to reverse the
       earlier change (again, they must meet the requirements for proposer
       and sponsor(s).)
    5. The proposer of a resolution may suggest changes to the wordings of
       amendments; these take effect if the proposer of the amendment
       agrees and none of the sponsors object. In this case the changed
       amendments will be voted on instead of the originals.
    6. The proposer of a resolution may make changes to correct minor
       errors (for example, typographical errors or inconsistencies) or
       changes which do not alter the meaning, providing noone objects
       within 24 hours. In this case the minimum discussion period is not
       restarted.

  A.2. Calling for a vote

    1. The proposer or a sponsor of a motion or an amendment may call for
       a vote, providing that the minimum discussion period (if any) has
       elapsed.
    2. The proposer or any sponsor of a resolution may call for a vote on
       that resolution and all related amendments.
    3. The person who calls for a vote states what they believe the
       wordings of the resolution and any relevant amendments are, and
       consequently what form the ballot should take. However, the final
       decision on the form of ballot(s) is the Secretary's - see 7.1(1),
       7.1(3) and A.3(4).
    4. The minimum discussion period is counted from the time the last
       formal amendment was accepted, or since the whole resolution was
       proposed if no amendments have been proposed and accepted.

  A.3. Voting procedure

    1. Each resolution and its related amendments is voted on in a single
       ballot that includes an option for the original resolution, each
       amendment, and the default option (where applicable).
    2. The default option must not have any supermajority requirements.
       Options which do not have an explicit supermajority requirement
       have a 1:1 majority requirement.
    3. The votes are counted according to the rules in A.6. The default
       option is "Further Discussion", unless specified otherwise.
    4. In cases of doubt the Project Secretary shall decide on matters of
       procedure.

  A.4. Withdrawing resolutions or unaccepted amendments

   The proposer of a resolution or unaccepted amendment may withdraw it.
   In this case new proposers may come forward keep it alive, in which
   case the first person to do so becomes the new proposer and any others
   become sponsors if they aren't sponsors already.

   A sponsor of a resolution or amendment (unless it has been accepted)
   may withdraw.

   If the withdrawal of the proposer and/or sponsors means that a
   resolution has no proposer or not enough sponsors it will not be voted
   on unless this is rectified before the resolution expires.

  A.5. Expiry

   If a proposed resolution has not been discussed, amended, voted on or
   otherwise dealt with for 4 weeks the secretary may issue a statement
   that the issue is being withdrawn. If none of the sponsors of any of
   the proposals object within a week, the issue is withdrawn.

   The secretary may also include suggestions on how to proceed, if
   appropriate.

  A.6. Vote Counting

    1. Each voter's ballot ranks the options being voted on. Not all
       options need be ranked. Ranked options are considered preferred to
       all unranked options. Voters may rank options equally. Unranked
       options are considered to be ranked equally with one another.
       Details of how ballots may be filled out will be included in the
       Call For Votes.
    2. If the ballot has a quorum requirement R any options other than the
       default option which do not receive at least R votes ranking that
       option above the default option are dropped from consideration.
    3. Any (non-default) option which does not defeat the default option
       by its required majority ratio is dropped from consideration.
         1. Given two options A and B, V(A,B) is the number of voters who
            prefer option A over option B.
         2. An option A defeats the default option D by a majority ratio
            N, if V(A,D) is greater or equal to N * V(D,A) and V(A,D) is
            strictly great
         3. If a supermajority of S:1 is required for A, its majority
            ratio is S; otherwise, its majority ratio is 1.
    4. From the list of undropped options, we generate a list of pairwise
       defeats.
         1. An option A defeats an option B, if V(A,B) is strictly greater
            than V(B,A).
    5. From the list of [undropped] pairwise defeats, we generate a set of
       transitive defeats.
         1. An option A transitively defeats an option C if A defeats C or
            if there is some other option B where A defeats B AND B
            transitively defeats C.
    6. We construct the Schwartz set from the set of transitive defeats.
         1. An option A is in the Schwartz set if for all options B,
            either A transitively defeats B, or B does not transitively
            defeat A.
    7. If there are defeats between options in the Schwartz set, we drop
       the weakest such defeats from the list of pairwise defeats, and
       return to step 5.
         1. A defeat (A,X) is weaker than a defeat (B,Y) if V(A,X) is less
            than V(B,Y). Also, (A,X) is weaker than (B,Y) if V(A,X) is
            equal to V(B,Y) and V(X,A) is greater than V(Y,B).
         2. A weakest defeat is a defeat that has no other defeat weaker
            than it. There may be more than one such defeat.
    8. If there are no defeats within the Schwartz set, then the winner is
       chosen from the options in the Schwartz set. If there is only one
       such option, it is the winner. If there are multiple options, the
       elector with the casting vote chooses which of those options wins.

   Note: Options which the voters rank above the default option are
   options they find acceptable. Options ranked below the default options
   are options they find unacceptable.

   When the Standard Resolution Procedure is to be used, the text which
   refers to it must specify what is sufficient to have a draft resolution
   proposed and/or sponsored, what the minimum discussion period is, and
   what the voting period is. It must also specify any supermajority
   and/or the quorum (and default option) to be used.

B. Use of language and typography

   The present indicative ("is", for example) means that the statement is
   a rule in this constitution. "May" or "can" indicates that the person
   or body has discretion. "Should" means that it would be considered a
   good thing if the sentence were obeyed, but it is not binding. Text
   marked as a citation, such as this, is rationale and does not form part
   of the constitution. It may be used only to aid interpretation in cases
   of doubt.

Appendix
The Debian Manifesto
********************


			The Debian Linux Manifesto

			Written by  Ian A. Murdock
			     Revised 01/06/94


What is Debian Linux?
=====================

Debian Linux is a brand-new kind of Linux distribution.  Rather than
being developed by one isolated individual or group, as other
distributions of Linux have been developed in the past, Debian is being
developed openly in the spirit of Linux and GNU.  The primary purpose
of the Debian project is to finally create a distribution that lives up
to the Linux name.  Debian is being carefully and conscientiously put
together and will be maintained and supported with similar care.

It is also an attempt to create a non-commercial distribution that will
be able to effectively compete in the commercial market.  It will
eventually be distributed by The Free Software Foundation on CD-ROM,
and The Debian Linux Association will offer the distribution on floppy
disk and tape along with printed manuals, technical support and other
end-user essentials.  All of the above will be available at little more
than cost, and the excess will be put toward further development of
free software for all users.  Such distribution is essential to the
success of the Linux operating system in the commercial market, and it
must be done by organizations in a position to successfully advance and
advocate free software without the pressure of profits or returns.


Why is Debian being constructed?
================================

Distributions are essential to the future of Linux.  Essentially, they
eliminate the need for the user to locate, download, compile, install
and integrate a fairly large number of essential tools to assemble a
working Linux system.  Instead, the burden of system construction is
placed on the distribution creator, whose work can be shared with
thousands of other users.  Almost all users of Linux will get their
first taste of it through a distribution, and most users will continue
to use a distribution for the sake of convenience even after they are
familiar with the operating system.  Thus, distributions play a very
important role indeed.

Despite their obvious importance, distributions have attracted little
attention from developers.  There is a simple reason for this: they are
neither easy nor glamorous to construct and require a great deal of
ongoing effort from the creator to keep the distribution bug-free and
up-to-date.  It is one thing to put together a system from scratch; it
is quite another to ensure that the system is easy for others to
install, is installable and usable under a wide variety of hardware
configurations, contains software that others will find useful, and is
updated when the components themselves are improved.

Many distributions have started out as fairly good systems, but as time
passes attention to maintaining the distribution becomes a secondary
concern.  A case-in-point is the Softlanding Linux System (better known
as SLS).  It is quite possibly the most bug-ridden and badly maintained
Linux distribution available; unfortunately, it is also quite possibly
the most popular.  It is, without question, the distribution that
attracts the most attention from the many commercial "distributors" of
Linux that have surfaced to capitalize on the growing popularity of the
operating system.

This is a bad combination indeed, as most people who obtain Linux from
these "distributors" receive a bug-ridden and badly maintained Linux
distribution.  As if this wasn't bad enough, these "distributors" have
a disturbing tendency to misleadingly advertise non-functional or
extremely unstable "features" of their product.  Combine this with the
fact that the buyers will, of course, expect the product to live up to
its advertisement and the fact that many may believe it to be a
commercial operating system (there is also a tendency not to mention
that Linux is free nor that it is distributed under the GNU General
Public License).  To top it all off, these "distributors" are actually
making enough money from their effort to justify buying larger
advertisements in more magazines; it is the classic example of
unacceptable behavior being rewarded by those who simply do not know
any better.  Clearly something needs to be done to remedy the
situation.


How will Debian attempt to put an end to these problems?
========================================================

The Debian design process is open to ensure that the system is of the
highest quality and that it reflects the needs of the user community.
By involving others with a wide range of abilities and backgrounds,
Debian is able to be developed in a modular fashion.  Its components
are of high quality because those with expertise in a certain area are
given the opportunity to construct or maintain the individual
components of Debian involving that area.  Involving others also
ensures that valuable suggestions for improvement can be incorporated
into the distribution during its development; thus, a distribution is
created based on the needs and wants of the users rather than the needs
and wants of the constructor.  It is very difficult for one individual
or small group to anticipate these needs and wants in advance without
direct input from others.

Debian Linux will also be distributed on physical media by the Free
Software Foundation and the Debian Linux Association.  This provides
Debian to users without access to the Internet or FTP and additionally
makes products and services such as printed manuals and technical
support available to all users of the system.  In this way, Debian may
be used by many more individuals and organizations than is otherwise
possible, the focus will be on providing a first-class product and not
on profits or returns, and the margin from the products and services
provided may be used to improve the software itself for all users
whether they paid to obtain it or not.

The Free Software Foundation plays an extremely important role in the
future of Debian.  By the simple fact that they will be distributing
it, a message is sent to the world that Linux is not a commercial
product and that it never should be, but that this does not mean that
Linux will never be able to compete commercially.  For those of you who
disagree, I challenge you to rationalize the success of GNU Emacs and
GCC, which are not commercial software but which have had quite an
impact on the commercial market regardless of that fact.

The time has come to concentrate on the future of Linux rather than on
the destructive goal of enriching oneself at the expense of the entire
Linux community and its future.  The development and distribution of
Debian may not be the answer to the problems that I have outlined in
the Manifesto, but I hope that it will at least attract enough
attention to these problems to allow them to be solved.
